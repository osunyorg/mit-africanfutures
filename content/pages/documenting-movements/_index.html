This political moment calls for <strong>continued pressure on states </strong>to fully recognize the historical injustices of colonization and slavery and their consequences, and to address racial inequalities.<br><br>We contribute to this effort by generating rigorous, empirically-grounded analyses developed through collaborations with academics, activists, lawyers, and policymakers and rendering these analyses for a wide range of audiences.
