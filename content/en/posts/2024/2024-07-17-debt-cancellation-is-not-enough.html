        <p>The report indicates that these are not demands to repair the past, but rather demands to end contemporary injustices that have concrete implications for the socio-political and economic future of the societies against which these injustices have been perpetrated.</p><p>Our research also shows that civil society organizations in Southern African countries are not unanimous on how to put an end to these colonial injustices, nor on the division of responsibilities between states and international financial institutions: </p><ul> <li> </li> <li>Some actors believe that debt cancellation can only be considered as a form of reparation for colonial injustice if the international financial architecture is reviewed.</li> <li>Others argue that if debt cancellation and reform of financial institutions are necessary, Southern African states should first tackle racial inequalities within their own countries before taking the fight to the international level. </li> </ul>
