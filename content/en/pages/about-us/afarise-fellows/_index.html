meta_description: >-
  AfaRise seeks to cultivate and support a cohort of visionary fellows from across Africa and Europe, working at the intersections of race, gender, climate, and economic justice. Whether applicants are developing a book, podcast, research project, artistic exhibition, or organizing campaign, AfaRise offers a platform to amplify, shape, and realize those visions.  Fellows will drive bold initiatives that connect grassroots realities with broader global narratives, grounded in intersectional and decolonial thought.
