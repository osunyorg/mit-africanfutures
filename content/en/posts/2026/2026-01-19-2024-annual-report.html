    2024 Annual Report
  summary: >-
    <p>In 2024, our work across Africa and Europe involved centering the communities whose experiences of racial injustice and historical harm are too often ignored. We endeavoured to make their demands visible in public debates, policy spaces, and global forums.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>We worked tirelessly and focused on deepening partnerships and creating spaces where affected communities could shape their own advocacy. Through three Mobilization Labs on human remains restitution, Métis justice, and climate reparations, we brought together activists, researchers, and community organizations to advance shared agendas grounded in lived realities. <br> Additionally, we launched our first major advocacy campaign on justice and reparations for Métis children abducted under Belgian colonial rule and their African mothers, opening new conversations in Geneva, Brussels, and beyond. Alongside sustained work on climate reparations through research, public debates, and our podcast, we strengthened South-South collaborations and laid the groundwork for our first regional office in Nairobi and the first-ever reparations festival in Africa. </p>  <p>  You can download the full report here:</p>
