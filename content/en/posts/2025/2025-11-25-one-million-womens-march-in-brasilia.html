  body: >-
    <p>  <br>On November 25, we joined the  One Million Women’s March  in Brasília in solidarity with Black women mobilizing for justice, dignity, and reparative futures. The march brought together Black women, grassroots organizers, community leaders, and feminist movements from across Brazil and beyond. Their demands were clear and collective: an end to racialized and gendered violence, economic justice that recognizes Black women’s labor, political visibility, and conditions for good living rooted in dignity and care. Our Executive Director, Liliane Umubyeyi, PhD , and  Partnerships and Advocacy Officer, Hélène Himmer , were on the ground, strengthening South-to-South feminist connections between African and Afro-descendant movements confronting global racial injustice together. One message echoed powerfully throughout the march: without reparations, there can be no democracy, no equality, and no dignity. Far from multilateral institutions that continue to fall short in addressing intersecting global crises, the streets of Brasília became a political space where Black women asserted visibility, collective power, and political clarity. This mobilization builds on the momentum of the Wakati Wetu Festival in Nairobi, co-organized with Reform Initiatives and the Deep South Solidarity Fund, where African and Afro-descendant communities came together to reimagine reparations on their own terms. Standing alongside Afro-Brazilian organizers brought these conversations into dialogue and reinforced a shared commitment to structural transformation rooted in lived realities. When Black women mobilize with clarity and purpose, they create space for new strategies, deeper solidarities, and futures shaped by justice and care.
