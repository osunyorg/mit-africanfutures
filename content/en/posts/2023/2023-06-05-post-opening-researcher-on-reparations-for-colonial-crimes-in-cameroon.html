    <p>  <br>			 <br>				 <br>					 <br>						 Duration : 2 months, June-July 2023 (flexible); includes field research. <br>  <br>						 Application deadline : Ongoing, until the position is filled. <br>  <br>						 Required qualifications: <br>  <br>						  <br> PhD or equivalent degree in qualitative and/or quantitative social sciences. <br>Relevant disciplines include, but are not limited to, sociology, anthropology, <br>history, political science and legal studies.  <br> Thematic expertise in reparations, restorative justice and/or racial justice <br>movements in Cameroon.  <br> Demonstrated experience in qualitative and/or quantitative social science <br>research, including field research.  <br> Proven experience in conducting operational research.  <br> Excellent writing skills, demonstrated by a record of publications.  <br> Required languages skills : French, English, one or more national languages <br>of the country.  <br>  <br>						 1) Project context <br>  <br>						 The African Futures Lab's (AfaLab) mission is to bring recognition and redress to past <br>and contemporary structural racial inequalities in Africa and Europe through the <br>development and exchange of rigorous, empirically-based knowledge. The <br>knowledge generated by this work informs the efforts of activists and policymakers. <br> To this end, AfaLab documents racial inequalities and racial justice movements <br>through large-scale quantitative data collection and in-depth case studies. Building <br>on this empirical foundation, AfaLab promotes knowledge exchange among social <br>actors engaged in the fight against racial inequality and supports advocacy efforts by <br>producing empirically-based policy recommendations for states, international <br>organizations, and grassroots actors. <br>  <br>					 <br>				 <br>				 <br>				 <br>				 <br>					 <br>						 <br>					 <br>				 <br>			 <br>		 <br>			 <br>				 <br>					 <br>						 2) Project description: "Advancing the Reparations Agenda for Colonial <br>Crimes and Slavery in Africa" <br>  <br>						 The issue of reparations for the historical injustices of colonization and slavery is <br>once more on the international agenda.  In recent years - and as result of pressure <br>from civil society actors - European states such as Belgium, the Netherlands and <br>Germany have undertaken processes of recognition of colonial violence in their <br>former African colonies, while international organizations such as the United Nations <br>have multiplied calls for states to make reparations for colonial and slavery-related <br>violence.  At the African Union level, a continental agenda for reparations is beginning <br>to take shape. But this growing attention to the issue of reparations cannot happen <br>without the contributions of African civil society. <br>  <br>						 Civil society on the African continent has already demonstrated its willingness to <br>have colonial crimes and their political, economic, social, and material consequences <br>recognized. For example, in East Africa, former Mau Mau fighters filed a lawsuit <br>seeking reparations for the torture they suffered during the struggle for <br>independence. In North Africa, the Tunisian Truth and Dignity Commission <br>established in 2014 demanded in its final report reparations from France for the <br>massive human rights violations committed by the French army between March 1956 <br>and July 1961, which resulted in over 7,000 Tunisian victims.  However, the <br>Commission's demands went unheeded. More recently, in southern Africa, after <br>years of negotiations, the Namibian government, obtained an apology from Germany <br>for the genocide that the colonial government perpetrated against the Nama and <br>Herero people in the early 20th century.  <br>						 Despite these advances, the scale and scope of ongoing efforts pale in comparison <br>to the scope of the crimes committed and their profound and lasting impact on <br>African societies, lives, and economies. <br>  <br>						 In order to contribute to the development of an African agenda based on sound, data- <br>driven knowledge, African Futures Lab launched the project "Advancing the <br>Reparations Agenda for Colonial Crimes and Slavery in Africa," supported by the <br>Open Society-Africa, has the following objectives:  <br>						  <br>  <br> Strengthen African civil society organizations' demands for reparations  related to colonial violence and slavery through sound, data-driven knowledge <br>  <br>  <br> Coordinate the efforts of African civil society actors  in developing a <br>reparations agenda for colonial violence and slavery  <br>  <br> Inform the development of policies  related to reparations for colonial crimes <br>and slavery at the international, regional, and national levels (in former <br>colonial powers and former colonized states) with recommendations from <br>African civil society actors  <br>  <br>			 <br>		  <br>		 <br>	 <br>	 <br>		 <br>		 <br>		  <br>			 <br>				 <br>					 <br>						 3) Specific project objectives  <br>					 <br>				 <br>				 <br>					 <br>						 As part of this broader initiative, we are carrying out research projects focusing on <br>each of the five regions of Africa. Each region is studied by one or two researchers. <br>This call specifically concerns one researcher for 1 country in the Central African <br>region:  Cameroon . <br>  <br>						 Objectives : To take stock of ongoing mobilizations for reparations in each region <br>and/or to analyze specific cases of reparations demands. <br>  <br>						 Specific questions that may guide the analysis: <br>  <br>						  <br> What are the demands for reparations for crimes committed during <br>colonization?  <br> Who are the actors making these demands? With what resources (political, <br>legal, media, material)? Which allies?  <br> In which arenas are demands being brought? To whom are they addressed?  <br> What is the history of these demands?  <br> What do these demands for reparations make possible for the mobilized <br>actors? What do they make difficult? <br>  <br>  <br>						 Operational aims of the research : To enable society actors to develop a political/ <br>legal/communication strategy for their demands for reparations for the historical <br>crimes and contemporary legacies of colonialism and slavery. <br>  <br>						 Duration : 2 months (June- July 2023). Those dates are flexible.  <br>Collaboration  with civil society actors and local universities is at the heart of this research.  <br>						 Two elements are central to this research:  It is operational in focus  and  it must <br>start from existing civil society actors' mobilizations on the ground . The <br>methodology can be qualitative or quantitative. <br>  <br>						 Female applicants are strongly encouraged. <br>  <br>						 Please send your CV and cover letter to  info@afalab.org.   <br>					 <br>				 <br>			 <br>		 <br>  Post opening: Researcher on reparations for colonial crimes in Cameroon</p>
