    Métis of the Great Lakes
  summary: >-
    <p>A Transnational Case for Justice and Reparations  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>Who Are the Métis?  <br>   <br>The Métis are biracial children born in the Belgian Congo, Burundi, and Rwanda to European fathers and African mothers. Under Belgian colonial rule, some 16,000 children were forcibly abducted—many institutionalized or displaced to Belgium—severing families and causing lifelong trauma. Of these, about 15,000 remained in the Great Lakes region.</p>  <p>   <br>1. Systematic Abduction <br>From 1890, Belgian authorities issued decrees to forcibly remove biracial children from their mothers, often claiming it was for their education and protection.Taken from their families, Métis children were placed in church-run missions known as colonies scolaires, where they were stripped of their African identity and forcibly "Europeanized." This segregation aimed to erase their roots and enforce colonial racial hierarchies.</p>  <p>2. Displacement and Statelessness <br>In the years leading to independence (1959–1962), hundreds of Métis children were relocated to Belgium. Once there, a 1960 ministerial circular revoked their Belgian nationality and labeled them illegitimate, leaving them stateless and cut off from both their African and European identities.</p>  <p>3. Abandonment and Trauma <br>At independence, most Métis children were left in institutions with no records, no support, and no connection to their families. Their stories are marked by deep emotional trauma, legal invisibility, and decades of silence. As one survivor shared: <br>  “It’s only with Georges Kamanayo’s report that I said to myself, ‘But I’m not alone!’”</p>  <p> Why we are involved  <br>The story of the Métis children is not just a colonial tragedy—it is a modern justice crisis. Their forced abduction, racial segregation, and abandonment under Belgian colonial rule reveal how the legacies of exploitation continue to inflict harm today. Families were destroyed, identities erased, and trauma passed through generations. This case aligns directly with African Futures Lab's mission: to confront historical and ongoing injustices, demand systemic change, and fight for reparations that are material, financial, and structural. </p>  <p> Our Advocacy in Action  <br>   <br>Dec 2 2024 - African Futures Lab and Amnesty International Joint Press Release <br>In a historic move, Belgium has been convicted of crimes against humanity for acts committed during colonization which must signal as a turning point for European States, said African Futures Lab and Amnesty International. <br> Today, the Brussels Court of Appeal recognized the responsibility of the Belgian State in the abduction and systematic racial segregation of Métis children under Belgian colonial rule, after five Métis women born between 1948 and 1952 in the Belgian Congo, initiated legal proceedings against the Belgian state. After a Brussels court ruled against their claims in 2021, they continued to seek redress and appealed the decision, reaching this historical ruling today. . <br> Like thousands of Métis children born to European fathers and African mothers, Marie-Josée Loshi, Noëlle Verbeken, Léa Tavares Mujinga, Simone Ngalula, and Monique Bintu Bingi were taken from their Congolese mothers, forcibly placed in religious institutions, deprived of their roots and identity, and later abandoned to fend for themselves when Congo gained independence. Even today, the wounds of that era remain profound. The Métis children of colonization still grapple with the consequences of these devastating practices, despite the official apology made by the Belgian Prime Minister at the time, Charles Michel, in 2018, and the Federal Parliament's adoption of the 'Métis Resolution' in 2019.</p>  <p>   <br>May 29, 2024: Brussels Conference <br>We co-organized a major conference titled “ African Mothers and their Métis Children Abducted by the Belgian Colonial Administration: What Progress Towards Justice and Reparations? ” with AEBLC, AMGL Burundi, Collectif Métis, and GERME to highlight Belgium's inadequate response. This event amplified the voices of those still fighting for recognition, justice, and reparations.</p>  <p>   <br>April 17, 2024: Advocacy at the UN (Geneva) <br>At the UN Permanent Forum of People of African Descent, we co-hosted a pivotal event: " Biracial Children, African Mothers and Colonization: A Global Case for Reparations. " We proposed formal recommendations urging European states to recognize these colonial crimes and called on Belgium to offer full redress: nationality, healthcare, compensation, and acknowledgment.</p>  <p>   <br>April 4 2024 <br>Des Métis abandonnés demandent justice pour les crimes coloniaux belges.</p>  <p>   <br>March 21, 2024: Global Campaign Launch <br>We launched a landmark report, " 70 Years of Fighting for Justice and Reparations! Mobilization by ‘Métis’ People from the Great Lakes Abducted by the Belgian Colonial Administration ”, alongside Amnesty International's Racial Justice team. The campaign uplifts the demands of Métis individuals and exposes Belgium's ongoing failure to provide justice for those displaced to Europe and those left behind in the Great Lakes region.</p>  <p> A Landmark Ruling: Toward Full Reparations for the Métis   <br>   <br>The struggle for justice for the Métis people has spanned decades—marked by piecemeal apologies, limited reforms, and persistent inaction, especially for those who remained in the Great Lakes region. Since 2015, the Belgian state has issued formal apologies, culminating in a 2019 apology from then- Prime Minister Charles Michel . The 2018 “Métis Resolution” offered a framework for redress but failed to deliver meaningful reparations. <br> Our research, and that of our partners, exposed ongoing barriers: denial of access to archives, lack of psychosocial support, blocked visas, and disregard for survivors in Africa. For many, Belgium’s response amounted to what the Association of Belgian Children Left in Congo (AEBLC) called a “politics of the grave”—waiting out victims rather than delivering justice.</p>  <p> December 2, 2024: Justice Delivered  <br>   <br>In a historic decision, the Brussels Court of Appeal convicted Belgium of crimes against humanity for its colonial abduction and racial segregation of Métis children. This victory—won by five courageous Métis women—marks a seismic shift in legal recognition of colonial abuses. Their persistent fight, after an initial dismissal in 2021, led to a powerful affirmation: colonial violence has enduring consequences and must be redressed. <br> As Léa Tavares Mujinga testified: <br> The Belgian state uprooted us, cut us off from our people. It stole our childhood, our lives, our first names, our surnames, our identities, and our human rights. This ruling is not just symbolic—it granted reparations the women deemed just and necessary, offering a foundation for broader systemic redress.</p>  <p> Our Demands for Reparations  <br>   <br>In light of this ruling, African Futures Lab calls for: <br>  <br> Full recognition and reparations from all European states involved in such colonial policies - material, financial, and systemic. <br>  <br> Legal accountability beyond apologies and symbolic resolutions. <br>  <br> Streamlined access to Belgian nationality, humanitarian visas, and DNA testing for Métis descendants. <br>  <br> Comprehensive healthcare support—including mental health—for all Métis of Belgian colonial descent. <br>  <br> Financial compensation for all victims, including African mothers whose children were taken. <br>  <br> Recognition of colonial crimes as crimes against humanity in international law, including the Rome Statute. <br>  <br> Public education and remembrance in Belgium, the DRC, Rwanda, and Burundi to preserve and honor Métis histories. </p>  <p> The Way Forward  <br>   <br>This historic decision represents long-awaited recognition and supports additional claims for reparations for Métis people, offering a beacon of hope for a future where justice prevails. We remain committed to ensuring these demands are met. Recognizing a crucial gap in the current discourse, with significant focus on the Métis children but less on their mothers, we are currently working on a documentary to feature the remaining mothers of these Métis children, allowing them to share their powerful stories and ensure their experiences are heard and documented.</p>

        <p>The struggle for justice for the Métis people has spanned decades—marked by piecemeal apologies, limited reforms, and persistent inaction, especially for those who remained in the Great Lakes region. Since 2015, the Belgian state has issued formal apologies, culminating in a 2019 apology from then-<a href="https://www.rtbf.be/article/charles-michel-je-presente-mes-excuses-aux-metis-issus-de-la-colonisation-belge-10187781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Prime Minister Charles Michel <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>. The 2018 “Métis Resolution” offered a framework for redress but failed to deliver meaningful reparations. </p><p>Our research, and that of our partners, exposed ongoing barriers: denial of access to archives, lack of psychosocial support, blocked visas, and disregard for survivors in Africa. For many, Belgium’s response amounted to what the Association of Belgian Children Left in Congo (AEBLC) called a “politics of the grave”—waiting out victims rather than delivering justice.</p>

        <p>In a historic decision, the Brussels Court of Appeal convicted Belgium of crimes against humanity for its colonial abduction and racial segregation of Métis children. This victory—won by five courageous Métis women—marks a seismic shift in legal recognition of colonial abuses. Their persistent fight, after an initial dismissal in 2021, led to a powerful affirmation: colonial violence has enduring consequences and must be redressed. </p><p>As Léa Tavares Mujinga testified: </p><p><i>The Belgian state uprooted us, cut us off from our people. It stole our childhood, our lives, our first names, our surnames, our identities, and our human rights.<q></q></i></p><p>This ruling is not just symbolic—it granted reparations the women deemed just and necessary, offering a foundation for broader systemic redress. </p>

        <p>In light of this ruling, African Futures Lab calls for: </p><ul> <li>Full recognition and reparations from all European states involved in such colonial policies - material, financial, and systemic. </li> <li>Legal accountability beyond apologies and symbolic resolutions. </li> <li>Streamlined access to Belgian nationality, humanitarian visas, and DNA testing for Métis descendants. </li> <li>Comprehensive healthcare support—including mental health—for all Métis of Belgian colonial descent. </li> <li>Financial compensation for all victims, including African mothers whose children were taken. </li> <li>Recognition of colonial crimes as crimes against humanity in international law, including the Rome Statute. </li> <li>Public education and remembrance in Belgium, the DRC, Rwanda, and Burundi to preserve and honor Métis histories.</li> </ul>

        <p>This historic decision represents long-awaited recognition and supports additional claims for reparations for Métis people, offering a beacon of hope for a future where justice prevails. We remain committed to ensuring these demands are met. Recognizing a crucial gap in the current discourse, with significant focus on the Métis children but less on their mothers, we are currently working on a documentary to feature the remaining mothers of these Métis children, allowing them to share their powerful stories and ensure their experiences are heard and documented.</p>
