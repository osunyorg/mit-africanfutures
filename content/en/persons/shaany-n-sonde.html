Shaany comes from a dual cultural background (France and the Republic of Congo), and holds a Bachelor's degree in History from the University Paris-Sorbonne, as well as a Masters in Political Science and International Relations from the Free University of Brussels. After working on a project that aimed to decolonize the Free University of Brussel's colonial legacy, Shaany completed her Masters thesis on movements to decolonize the public space in Brussels.
