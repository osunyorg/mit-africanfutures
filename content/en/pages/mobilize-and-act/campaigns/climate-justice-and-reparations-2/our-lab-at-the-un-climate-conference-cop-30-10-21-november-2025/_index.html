    10-21 Nov 2025 | UN Climate Conference COP 30
  summary: >-
    <p>Our delegation attended COP 30 with a clear message: Africa's demand for climate reparations is not charity - it is a legal, moral, and political obligation owed by those most responsible for the climate crisis to those least responsible and most harmed.  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>Why COP 30 is a defining moment for Africa  <br>   <br>African nations contribute less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions yet face widespread devastation. Communities and states across the continent are bearing the full brunt of the crisis: worsening  desertification, heatwaves, floods, droughts, and the destruction of biodiversity . On a human and economic level, the losses caused by extreme climate events are enormous, reaching up to 5% of annual GDP in some African nations, while the estimated financial needs to respond lie  between 187 and 359 billion US dollars annually . Meanwhile, Africa receives only a small fraction of the climate finance needed, often in the form of debt-creating loans. This disparity is an unfair, direct violation of basic human rights and a continuation of structural injustice. African Futures Lab will be on the ground at COP 30 in Belém, Brazil, an Afro-descendant and Amazonian city, to advance an African-led vision of climate justice. The climate crisis is rooted in colonial extraction, racialized exploitation, and structural inequality, yet all too often this reality is invisibilized in the negotiations and in global climate action. Our work at COP30 aims to shift the global climate narrative from one of aid and charity to one of structural transformation rooted in reparative justice.  We see COP 30 as a pivotal space to connect African struggles with those of Afro-descendant and Indigenous peoples across Latin America, the Caribbean, and the broader Global South. Together, these movements can amplify calls for accountability, solidarity, and systemic change.  </p>  <p> The legal terrain has shifted   <br>   <br>In July 2025, the  International Court of Justice (ICJ)  affirmed that high-emitting states have binding legal duties related to climate change. Crucially:  High-emitting states that fail to prevent climate harms must provide reparations.   And secondly, climate reparations are not optional, they are a settled principle of international law. This landmark opinion thus confirms and reinforces long-standing demands for climate reparations as a  non-negotiable legal obligation .  It provides African states and civil society with new leverage to demand compensation, grant-based financing, technology transfer and structural reforms based on justice. African states must now translate this legal clarity into coordinated, assertive positions in global negotiations. </p>  <p>Learn what the ICJ's Advisory Opinion means for Africa <br>https://www.afalab.org/mobilize-and-act/campaigns/climate-justice-and-reparations-2/the-icj-opinion-a-new-era-for-climate-governance-rooted-in-reparations-eng/</p>  <p> Did COP 30 deliver justice for Africans and Afro-descendants?   <br>   <br>The ICJ's Advisory Opinion may have cracked open a new legal horizon for accountability, but as COP 30 demonstrated, moral clarity does not automatically translate into political will.   <br> African and Afro-descendant delegates arrived not seeking charity, but demanding a shift from aid to repair; from carbon metrics to lived realities. In every forum - side events, movement gathering, coordination meetings, media spaces and even in protests that broke through the COP gates, a new language of climate action is emerging  that speaks not of aid, but of repair.  <br> When Indigenous peoples  stormed the venue  to denounce their exclusion, and when Afro-Brazilian activists like Thuane Nascimento, Executive Director of PerifaConnection reminded the world that  "climate change is not neutral,"  they exposed the core question:  <br> Whose justice counts, and who gets to decide?  <br> Although the UNFCCC process continues to sidestep reparations, the word now lives in the streets, the courts, and the collective conscience of social movements worldwide.  African movements are reframing the debate not as a plea for inclusion, but as a declaration of authority.   </p>  <p>Explore our work on climate reparations <br>https://www.afalab.org/mobilize-and-act/campaigns/climate-justice-and-reparations-2/</p>  <p> Old wine in old bottles? The limits of the UNFCCC system   <br>   <br>COP 30 also made it clear that the current system is reaching its limits.   <br> The UNFCCC process remains slow, overly technical and constrained by entrenched power, compounded by the staggering presence of  fossil fuel lobbyists . Prospects for a just, gender-responsive fossil fuel phaseout and equitable reparative climate finance are fading out of view.  <br> As the global climate community considers alternatives, one thing is clear:   <br> We must build spaces that center Africans and Afro-descendants, recognize the unequal burden on Black women and empower their leadership, and make reparative justice the foundation of climate action.  </p>  <p>Join our mailing list to follow these developments  <br>https://www.afalab.org/how-to-support-us/subscribe-to-our-newsletter/</p>  <p> Growing civil society momentum on climate reparations   <br>   <br>The climate crisis is not only a question of mitigation and adaptation, but also a question of justice.  <br> In 2025, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) affirmed that states have binding obligations on climate, including responsibilities tied to historical emissions and regulation of fossil fuel industries. Yet, in the UNFCCC negotiations, these legal obligations were largely ignored. Civil society mobilized to push back, and AfaLab was at the forefront of this effort.  <br> Together with our partner,    La Ruta del Clima , we continue to co-lead the global  Climate  Reparations Working Group . In Belém we  co-drafted an  open letter on reparations for loss and damage , which garnered  over  100 civil-society signatures from  Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, demonstrating growing momentum for reparations as a central, actionable demand in climate policy.   </p>  <p>Read the open letter <br>https://larutadelclima.org/2025/11/16/reparations-for-loss-and-damage-at-cop30/</p>  <p> Our Lab on the ground in Belém   <br>   <br>1. Shifting the Global Narrative AfaLab's interventions reframed climate action as a matter of  structural and reparative justice. In The Continent,  Lavender Namdiero  called out the gap between political talk and lived reality. While COP30 rolled back a fossil-fuel phaseout roadmap, African negotiators demanded justice, grant-based finance, forest protection, resilient food systems, and faster disbursement from the Loss and Damage Fund. " Even when the word 'reparations' isn't spoken, its meaning is present everywhere, in demands for dignity, protection, recognition, and repair,"  Lavender wrote. Another op-ed we co-authored exposed how the exclusion of African journalists and voices from COP30 distorts global narratives, making clear that African perspectives must be amplified. 2. Strengthening South-South Solidarity  Grassroots solidarity was at the heart of our work.  We supported our partner  La Ruta del Clima  in the launch of the  Reparations Hub , a unique transnational policy and advocacy space for shared strategy-building, exchanging lessons learned, elevating case studies, and coordinated advocacy across the Global South.   During the first week our Lab convened a fishbowl discussion on False Solutions, Carbon Colonialism and Climate Reparations, which acted as a rare space for unfiltered exchange between African civil society and grassroots activists at the COP, with participation from like-minded activists from the Global South.   As co-lead of the Reparations Working Group, we facilitated dialogue and knowledge exchange among African, Latin American, and Caribbean movements, including through a Climate Reparations Workshop.   At the People's COP dialogue in week 2, convened by  Hélène Himmer , communities discussed linked struggles for racial and climate justice, culminating in calls for structural accountability.  We also participated in the  climate march  in Belém to reinforce public calls for accountability.  3. Building Long-Term Alliances  During COP30, we forged and strengthened alliances with:   <br> Power Shift Africa    <br> La Ruta del Clima     <br> Climate Action Network (CAN) Africa    <br> World's Youth for Climate Justice   Fellow African NGOs mobilizing for justice and accountability  These partnerships ensure that the momentum created at COP 30 continues beyond the conference.   </p>  <p> Highlights from COP 30   <br>  </p>  <p>Lavender Namdiero & Patrick Toussaint at the African Pavilion  </p>  <p>Hélène</p>  <p> Himmer at the COP30 entrance  </p>  <p>African Futures Lab publications  </p>  <p>Fishbowl on False Solutions, Carbon Colonialism and Climate Reparations  </p>  <p>Fishbowl on False Solutions, Carbon Colonialism and Climate Reparations  </p>  <p>People's COP Dialogue on Shared Struggles for Racial x Climate Justice  </p>  <p>Hélène</p>  <p>Himmer (AfaLab), Thuane Nascimento (PerifaConnection), Cheryl Kwapong (Clima Diaspora) & Mônica Oliveira (Black Coalition for Rights) at the panel on "Afrodescendants in the fight for climate justice: Gathering of the global diaspora."</p>  <p>Participants from the People's COP Dialogue on "Dialogue among Africans and Afrodescendants: Shared Struggles for Climate and Racial Justice."</p>  <p>Lavender Namdiero & Patrick Toussaint at the Climate March in Belém  </p>  <p>Civil society action in the blue zone</p>  <p> Media highlights and news coverage  <br>   <br>The Continent   <br>Lavender Namdiero  argues that Africa's climate demands are rooted squarely in reparative justice, showing why climate reparations are unavoidable for communities already experiencing irreversible harm. Read the full piece  here .     </p>  <p>Climate Lens Kenya  <br>With African civil-society partners, AfaLab underscored that excluding African voices distorts global narratives and hides African communities' lived realities and their demands for justice, finance, and accountability.  Read the full piece  here .   </p>  <p> What next after COP 30?  <br>   <br>COP 30 is not the end of this work. We are committed to sustaining the momentum for African-led climate justice through:  Coordinating of the Reparations Working Group and transatlantic advocacy through the  Reparations Hub   Driving advocacy across African climate summits and toward COP32 in Ethiopia  Expanding workshops, briefings, webinars and media engagements to keep reparations in the public arena  Strengthening South-South alliances for shared strategy and accountability  Deepening the evidence base for climate reparations through research   Advocating within the African Union decade on " Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations " to embed climate reparations at continental level.      </p>  <p> Our partners at COP 30  <br>  </p>  <p>La Ruta del Clima  </p>  <p>Marcha Das Mulheres Negras</p>  <p>Perifa Connection</p>

        <p><b>1. Shifting the Global Narrative</b></p><p>AfaLab's interventions reframed climate action as a matter of<b> structural and reparative justice.</b></p><p>In The Continent, <a href="https://www.afalab.org/lavender-namdiero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lavender Namdiero  <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>called out the gap between political talk and lived reality. While COP30 rolled back a fossil-fuel phaseout roadmap, African negotiators demanded justice, grant-based finance, forest protection, resilient food systems, and faster disbursement from the Loss and Damage Fund. "<i>Even when the word 'reparations' isn't spoken, its meaning is present everywhere, in demands for dignity, protection, recognition, and repair,"</i> Lavender wrote.</p><p>Another op-ed we co-authored exposed how the exclusion of African journalists and voices from COP30 distorts global narratives, making clear that African perspectives must be amplified.</p><p><b>2. Strengthening South-South Solidarity </b></p><p>Grassroots solidarity was at the heart of our work. </p><p>We supported our partner <a href="https://larutadelclima.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">La Ruta del Clima <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> in the launch of the <a href="https://larutadelclima.org/2025/10/09/hub-reparaciones-climaticas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reparations Hub <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>, a unique transnational policy and advocacy space for shared strategy-building, exchanging lessons learned, elevating case studies, and coordinated advocacy across the Global South.  </p><p>During the first week our Lab convened a fishbowl discussion on False Solutions, Carbon Colonialism and Climate Reparations, which acted as a rare space for unfiltered exchange between African civil society and grassroots activists at the COP, with participation from like-minded activists from the Global South.  </p><p>As co-lead of the Reparations Working Group, we facilitated dialogue and knowledge exchange among African, Latin American, and Caribbean movements, including through a Climate Reparations Workshop.  </p><p>At the People's COP dialogue in week 2, convened by <a href="https://www.afalab.org/helene-himmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hélène Himmer <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>, communities discussed linked struggles for racial and climate justice, culminating in calls for structural accountability.  We also participated in the <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2025/11/16/tens-of-thousands-march-at-cop30-as-indigenous-led-protest-shakes-stalled-climate-talks_6747497_114.html#:~:text=COP30-,Tens%20of%20thousands%20march%20at%20COP30%20as%20Indigenous%2Dled%20protest,negotiators%20and%20spotlighting%20Indigenous%20rights." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">climate march <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> in Belém to reinforce public calls for accountability. </p><p><b>3.
