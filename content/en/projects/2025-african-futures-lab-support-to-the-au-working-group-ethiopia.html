    <p>  <br>This is the chance for African Futures Lab to shape regional discussions on African climate justice and reparations, directly aligning with the AU's theme for the year: "Justice for Africans and people of African Descent through reparations." Key Activities with the Climate Change Working Group (CCWG)  <br> •	Develop actionable policy recommendations on climate finance <br> •	Engage in COP30 preparations to ensure African priorities are reflected in discussions.  <br> •	Organize webinars, workshops, and events to strengthen civil society’s engagement.  <br> •	Conduct research to support evidence-based advocacy at COP30.  <br> African Futures Lab’s participation will ensure that AU climate policies are informed by rigorous, empirically based knowledge, which is a hallmark of the African Futures Lab's approach. </p>
