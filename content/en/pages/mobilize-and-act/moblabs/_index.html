    <p>  <br>The invisibility of global racial injustices in public debate has made it difficult for civil society actors and private or public entities to advocate for justice and reparations or to take responsibility. Those who are willing to tackle these injustices feel powerless.  AfaLab supports civil society organizations, as well as private and public entities, in building and implementing strategies to tackle these racial injustices across Africa and Europe.  </p>  <p> What is a MobLab  <br> Gender justice  <br>   <br>Centering Black women in the fight for justice. AfaLab exposes and resists gendered colonial violence through research, advocacy, and action.</p>  <p> Climate justice  <br>   <br>Exposing colonial roots of the climate crisis. AfaLab fights for climate reparations led by African voices, grounded in justice and accountability.</p>  <p>   <br>A Mobilization Lab (MobLab) is a collaborative working space where strategies can be developed and/or strengthened. As multiple forms of expertise are necessary for revealing the many facets of global racial injustices, MobLabs brings together a range of specialists: historians, economists, anthropologists, lawyers, community organizers, communication experts, and other relevant experts.  <br> The result of this collaborative work can be an advocacy campaign or the implementation of policy reforms. </p>  <p> Every contribution writes a new future.  <br>Racial injustice is global and ongoing. At AFaLab, we mobilize research, strategy, and solidarity to dismantle it.
