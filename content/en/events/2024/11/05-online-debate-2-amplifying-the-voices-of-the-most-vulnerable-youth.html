    <p>  <br>In the second online debate on climate reparations, panelists  Hamira Kobusingye  and  Hyacinthe Niyitegeka  brought their expertise in grassroots activism and climate justice to the forefront. Hamira, a climate activist from Uganda and founder of  Yanayi Haki Afriqya  (Climate Justice Africa), emphasized the importance of engaging communities to understand the impact of international policies on local realities. She highlighted the need for accessible funding and the active participation of women, who are disproportionately affected by climate change, in decision-making processes. Hamira also addressed the barriers young activists face, including visa issues that hinder their attendance at international events. Hyacinthe, a water scientist and climate negotiator specializing in Loss and Damage, serves as Coordinator at the  Loss and Damage Collaboration (L&DC) . She focused on strategies to empower negotiators and build confidence among young activists, stressing the value of storytelling to ground discussions in real experiences. Both speakers underscored that climate reparations must target root causes like poverty and inequity, advocating for tailored solutions that respect local needs. The debate concluded with both panelists calling for stronger connections between generations in climate advocacy, with older generations supporting and empowering youth. </p>
