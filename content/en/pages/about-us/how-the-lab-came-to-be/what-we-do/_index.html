    <p>  <br>Raising awareness of global racial injustices across Africa and Europe Until now, racial injustice state policies <br>and civil society programs have focused on inequalities in specific nations <br>without looking at their global manifestation.  It is difficult for <br>civil society actors, as well as private and public entities, to advocate for <br>justice and reform, or to take responsibility, when global racial injustices <br>are made invisible.  African Futures Lab raises public awareness of the nature, scale, and  consequences  of the otherwise overlooked global racial injustices on the everyday lives of racialized populations in Africa and Europe.  <br> Empowering civil society and private or public actors to tackle global racial injustices   <br> Civil society actors and private or public entities who want to seek justice, reparations, or undertake structural reforms within their policies or organizations, are often powerless due to the erasure of global racial injustices. There is little knowledge or expertise developed on the topic.  African Futures Lab is filling this gap. With our research and network of experts, we support civil society actors and private or public entities in demanding justice and reparations as well as implementing structural policy reform. Our work is:  → Transdisciplinary African Futures Lab draws on various forms of knowledge and expertise, including history, law, economics, social sciences, and artistic and cultural know-how. → Intersectional Through our mandate and the way we work, we combat racial inequalities that are intertwined with, but do not erase, other inequalities based on gender, class, name, religion, sexual orientation, and ability. </p>
