biography: >-
  <p>Sihem Bensedrine is a writer, journalist, and a figure in the fight for human rights in Tunisia. She has worked for more than three decades to denounce human rights violations. Under the despotic regime of Ben Ali, deposed in 2011, she was imprisoned, persecuted, and subjected to smear campaigns and slander. From June 2014 to December 2018, Sihem Bensedrine was president of the “Truth and Dignity Instance” which implemented the law on transitional justice and published a comprehensive report on human rights violations, including recommendations on institutional reforms. In this report, Tunisia addressed a memorandum to France asking for reparations for colonial crimes.</p>
