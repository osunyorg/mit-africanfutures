    Intersectional approach to reparations
  summary: >-
    <p>At African Futures Lab, we understand that true reparations must be inherently intersectional. The struggles for climate justice, gender equality, and economic liberation are deeply connected—each rooted in systems of colonialism and racism. That’s why our transdisciplinary approach addresses the overlapping crises facing Black communities around the world. </p>

      <p>From restricted mobility and crushing debt to the dispossession of cultural heritage, we confront these critical intersections, knowing that only holistic solutions can dismantle the lasting legacies of colonial and racial oppression.</p>
