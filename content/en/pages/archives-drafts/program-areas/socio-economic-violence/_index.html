    <p>  <br>There are many studies that point to socio-economic inequalities between racialized and white populations on a global scale.</p>  <p>   <br>In the case of the African continent, this is typically blamed—in both popular and dominant political conversation—on the dysfunction of post-colonial African states and institutions. This perspective obscures the responsibility of former colonial powers.</p>  <p>   <br>Our program on  socio-economic inequality  analyzes colonial institutions and structures in today’s context to show their consequences on the lives of African and Afro-diasporic populations.</p>
