biography: >-
  <p>Liliane Umubyeyi is a Rwandan and Belgian Rule of Law and Access to Justice researcher and practitioner. Prior to establishing African Futures Lab in 2021, Liliane worked over 6 years in the field of international development (United Nations, Lawyers without Borders, International Center for Transitional Justice, and the American Bar Association) on projects concerning access to justice for marginalized groups, transitional justice, and gender justice. This professional background and her lived experience in Africa (Rwanda, South Africa, Central African Republic) and in Europe (Belgium, France) inform her thinking about the decolonization of development policy, the decolonization of international law and justice systems, and the possibilities for repairing historical and contemporary racial violence. Liliane holds a PhD in Social Sciences from the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan (France) and in Law from the Université Saint Louis Bruxelles (Belgium), and her dissertation focused on apartheid victims' mobilizations in South African and American courts.</p>
