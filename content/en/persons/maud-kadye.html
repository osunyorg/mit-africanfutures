biography: >-
  <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maud-k-35166665/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Maud <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> is the founder of<i><b> <a href="https://www.lpfdevelopment.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Level the Playing Field in Development <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> & Beyond Aid Narratives</b></i>, decolonial communications initiatives dedicated to dismantling the "white savior" industrial complex within the global development sector. Her work shifts the power of narrative production away from external organizations and back to the African and diaspora communities who own these stories. Through ethical communications training and advocacy against colonial imagery, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maud-k-35166665/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Maud  <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>is building a pan-African network of storytellers committed to narrative sovereignty. Her <a href="https://www.lpfdevelopment.org/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">project  <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>intervenes directly in development discourse, rejecting charity-based frameworks in favor of structural accountability and community-led representation. </p>
