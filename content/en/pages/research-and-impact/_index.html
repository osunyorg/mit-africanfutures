    <p>  <br>The research reports and policy papers are action-oriented: Ideas and knowledge inform public discussions and guide decision-makers in their efforts to undertake reform. Recognizing that the production of knowledge is profoundly political, our research methodology centers historically marginalized voices, based on race, nationality, gender, religion, ability, or other factors. Our research methodology takes a cross-disciplinary approach: We value a wide range of expertise and we invite as many different voices to the table as possible.

The Métis are biracial children born in the Belgian Congo, Burundi, and Rwanda to European fathers and African mothers. Under Belgian colonial rule, some 16,000 children were forcibly abducted-many institutionalized or displaced to Belgium-severing families and causing lifelong trauma. Of these, about 15,000 remained in the Great Lakes region. From 1890, Belgian authorities issued decrees to forcibly remove biracial children from their mothers, often claiming it was for their education and protection.Taken from their families, Métis children were placed in church-run missions known as colonies scolaires, where they were stripped of their African identity and forcibly "Europeanized." This segregation aimed to erase their roots and enforce colonial racial hierarchies. In the years leading to independence (1959-1962), hundreds of Métis children were displaced to Belgium. Once there, a 1960 ministerial circular revoked their Belgian nationality and labeled them illegitimate, leaving them stateless and cut off from both their African and European identities. At independence, most Métis children were left in institutions with no records, no support, and no connection to their families. Their stories are marked by deep emotional trauma, legal invisibility, and decades of silence, as one survivor shared. Why are we involved? The story of the Métis children is not just a colonial tragedy - it is a modern justice crisis. Their forced abduction, racial segregation, and abandonment under Belgian colonial rule reveal how the legacies of exploitation continue to inflict harm today. Families were destroyed, identities erased, and trauma passed through generations. This case aligns directly with African Futures Lab's mission: to confront historical and ongoing injustices, demand systemic change, and fight for reparations that are material, financial, and structural.   </p>
