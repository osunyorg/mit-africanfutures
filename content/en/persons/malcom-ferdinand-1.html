biography: >-
  <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/malcomsun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Malcom's  <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>work sits at the intersection of racial justice and ecological politics. His research examines how environmental change, pollution, and climate-related crises disproportionately impact Afro-descendant communities, while systematically excluding them from environmental decision-making spaces.</p><p>Through his AfaRise project, <i><b>Ecologies and Racism in Afro-descendant Communities</b></i>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/malcomsun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Malcom <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> documents forms of environmental racism across Western Europe and France’s overseas territories, while foregrounding the ecological philosophies, practices, and political knowledge developed within these communities. Combining political philosophy and empirical research, his work challenges dominant environmental frameworks that erase colonial responsibility and racialized harm.</p><p>Malcom’s research connects European contexts with African continental experiences to inform rights-based, reparative environmental policies that center justice, accountability, and community agency.</p>
