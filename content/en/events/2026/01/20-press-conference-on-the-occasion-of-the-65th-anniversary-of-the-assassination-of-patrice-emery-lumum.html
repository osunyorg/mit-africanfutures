meta_description: >-
  ixty-five years after the assassination of Patrice Émery Lumumba, the first  democratically elected Prime Minister of independent Congo, Étienne Davignon  remains the last surviving indicted individual in this case. With the hearing that will  decide whether the criminal trial will take place approaching on 20 January in Brussels,  the Lumumba family asserts that this is likely the last opportunity for the Belgian justice  system to ‘give truth a chance’ and to rule on criminal responsibilities for the war crimes  that led to the death of Patrice Lumumba on 17 January 1961. Refusing such judicial  scrutiny would definitely entrench the impunity for major colonial crimes.
