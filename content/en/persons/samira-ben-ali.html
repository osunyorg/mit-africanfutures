biography: >-
  <p>Samira is a climate justice advocate from the island of Mayotte, and an experienced storyteller and campaigner with a background in international environmental law.   </p><p>Samira's "Chirika Yatru" project aims to create a platform raising awareness on the environmental injustices faced in "overseas territories". It will share lived narratives, legal frameworks, and calls to action. Rooted in a decolonial perspective, the project connects environmental and climate justice with dignity, self-determination, and reparation, while centering voices from colonized and formerly colonized territories as an act of political, cultural resistance and collective care.  </p>
