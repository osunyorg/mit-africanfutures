    <p>  <br>The African Futures Lab (AfaLab) is launching AfaRise Fellows - emphasizing elevation,  resistance and vision: a bold, two-year, fully virtual fellowship for visionary young researchers and activists dedicated to dismantling racial injustice across Africa and the global diaspora.  Rooted in reparatory justice, decolonial praxis, and Afro-feminist leadership, the fellowship fosters cross-continental collaboration and strategic action across the fields of race, gender, climate, and economic justice.Unlike conventional fellowships, AfaRise is explicitly anchored in reparatory justice, decolonial praxis, and Afro-feminist leadership - equipping fellows not only to influence policy, but to reshape the very narratives and systems that uphold racial injustice. Click here for details Application link: https://bit.ly/44yjUtn </p>  <p> Background and rationale  <br>   <br>Founded by two Black women, Liliane Umubyeyi and Amah Edoh, in response to the global reckoning on racial injustice following the 2020 Black Lives Matter movement, African Futures Lab advances reparative justice through research, advocacy, and cross-continental solidarity. Our mission is rooted in dismantling the enduring legacies of colonialism and slavery, holding state and private actors accountable, and supporting African and Afro-descendant communities to reclaim truth, dignity, and power. <br> The fellowship aligns with the African Union’s 2025 declaration as the  Year of Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations -  a pivotal moment to drive bold advocacy in a time of rising authoritarianism, global inequality, and fractured solidarity.  <br> While interest in reparations for racial injustices and decoloniality grows, African actors remain under-resourced, disconnected, and sidelined. AfaRise addresses this gap by cultivating a cohort of racial justice movers equipped to act locally and globally from an African and Afro-diasporic lens. <br> =&gt; Spark and support bold initiatives tackling racial justice and reparations across Africa and Europe <br> This dynamic program is designed to spark and support bold initiatives tackling racial justice and reparations across Africa and Europe. Whether you'ree dreaming of writing a book, launching a podcast, weaving change into your organization, or curating a transformative art exhibition -  this is your space to bring those ideas to life.  We are here to ignite and nurture projects that engage deeply with decolonization, racial justice, and reparations.</p>  <p>  Fellowship structure  <br>   <br>Duration:  2 years (2025-2027) Format:  Fully virtual with bi-monthly online meetings Core Components  <br> Strategic reflections through peer knowledge exchange: Bi-monthly convenings to analyze developments on projects, build responses, and adapt strategy.  <br> Strengthening intersectional knowledge on racial justice and reparations: Fellow-led programming on race and reparations and its link with gender, decoloniality, climate, AI, economic, and emerging justice issues.  <br> Collaborative outputs: The fellowship program is a space to initiate collaborations among the fellows or between the lab and the fellows.   <br> Public representation: Fellows may represent AfaLab in multilateral events, regional, or civil society spaces.  <br> Alumni integration: Ongoing opportunities for publication, events and strategic collaboration. </p>  <p> What you will gain from this experience:  <br>   <br>  <br> A vibrant circle of peers and experts  ready to exchange ideas, challenge assumptions, and help shape your vision for your project.   <br>  <br> Access to the African Futures Lab network,  offering valuable connections and support to move your project forward.  <br>  <br> Opportunities to showcase your work  through our conferences and podcast platforms, amplifying your voice and reach.  <br>  <br> Possibilities for collaboration with our team  because we believe in co-creating impact.  <br>  <br> A stipend of €200 per working session,  recognizing and supporting your commitment to the project. </p>  <p> Roles and responsibilities  <br>   <br> Engage in regular virtual gatherings and knowledge-sharing sessions.  <br> Give regular update on the advancement of their project  <br> Prepare a final presentation of their project  </p>  <p> Eligibility and candidate profile  <br>   <br>Target group Activists, practitioners, researchers and artists engaged on projects tied to decoloniality, racial justice and reparations based in Africa and Europe.  Required qualifications  <br> Demonstrated commitment to racial justice across any relevant thematic (gender, climate, economics, etc.)  <br> A project at a very initial phase aiming at dismantling racial injustices across Africa and Europe / at a global scale  <br> Contextual understanding of Africa, Europe, or Afro-diasporic communities.  <br> Visionary, collaborative, and innovative approach to social change.  <br> Desirable assets  <br> Multilingual (especially French and English)  <br> Cross-sectoral, interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary experience  <br> Evaluation and interviews Applications will be assessed for merit, thematic fit, and diversity.
