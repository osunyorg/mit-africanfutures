    <p>  <br>From June 19 - 20, 2025, our Executive Director  Liliane Umubyeyi, PhD  joined leading transitional justice experts at the 5th AU-EU Experts' Seminar on Transitional Justice in Abuja, Nigeria.  Co-hosted by the African Union and European Union, the seminar was organized in collaboration with the  International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) , the  Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation (CSVR) , and the  Africa Transitional Justice Legacy Fund (ATJLF) .   This year's theme -  "Reparations and Transitional Justice: Perspectives and Approaches from Africa and Europe"  brought together over 50 experts to examine reparations as a cornerstone of justice for historical and contemporary harms, including enslavement, colonial violence, and systemic racism. Discussions focused on sustainable funding models, gender-responsive reparations, environmental justice, and the integration of rehabilitation into reparation frameworks.   Liliane moderated a session titled "The Economics of Reparations: Designing, Funding and Sustaining Reparations Programs," which explored practical strategies for making reparations financially viable and enduring.  This two-day exchange aimed to strengthen cross-continental collaboration and deepen shared knowledge on how to design inclusive, victim-centered reparation programs.  As the  African Union marks 2025 as the Year of Justice for Africans and People of African Descent , African Futures Lab remains committed to advancing reparatory and transformative justice through sustained collaboration and policy engagement.    </p>
