    <p>African Futures Lab mobilization work aims at empowering civil society actors and private or public entities to demand justice and achieve reform.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The invisibility of global racial injustices in public debate has made it difficult for civil society actors and private or public entities to advocate for justice and reparations or to take responsibility. Those who are willing to tackle these injustices feel powerless.  AfaLab supports civil society organizations, as well as private and public entities, in building and implementing strategies to tackle these racial injustices across Africa and Europe.  This support is built through  collaborative working spaces i.e. Mobilization Labs (MobLabs)  where strategies can be developed and/or strengthened. As multiple forms of expertise are necessary for revealing the many facets of global racial injustices, MobLabs brings together a range of specialists: historians, economists, anthropologists, lawyers, community organisers, communication experts and other relevant experts.  The result of this collaborative work can be an advocacy campaign or the implementation of policy reforms.  </p>  <p> What is a MobLab?  <br>   <br>Where knowledge becomes action. MobLabs are collaborative spaces where activists, researchers, and institutions come together to design bold strategies for racial justice.They turn shared knowledge into collective action-through campaigns, reforms, and long-term alliances.</p>  <p> Gender justice  <br>   <br>Centering Black women in the fight for justice. AfaLab exposes and resists gendered colonial violence through research, advocacy, and action.</p>  <p> Climate justice  <br>   <br>Exposing colonial roots of the climate crisis. AfaLab fights for climate reparations led by African voices, grounded in justice and accountability.</p>  <p> Every contribution writes a new future.  <br>Racial injustice is global - and ongoing.At AFaLab, we mobilize research, strategy, and solidarity to dismantle it. Your donation fuels action, empowers communities, and helps build a future rooted in dignity and repair.</p>  <p>Donate <br>https://www.afalab.org/how-to-support-us/donate/</p>  <p>Be part of the Movement <br>https://www.afalab.org/how-to-support-us/subscribe-to-our-newsletter/</p>
