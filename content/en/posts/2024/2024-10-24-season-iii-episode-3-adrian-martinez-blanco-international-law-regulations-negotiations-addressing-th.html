    <p>Season III Episode 3 - Adrián Martinez Blanco</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>This episode of  Future Perfect | Futur Antérieur  is co-hosted by Patrick Toussaint, an international environmental lawyer, and Helene Himmer, Program Assistant at African Futures Lab. Both welcomed the special guest Adrián Martinez Blanco, Director of  La Ruta del Clima . The discussion finds roots in a recent case about the ongoing struggle of communities in Côte d'Ivoire against the Belgian multinational SIAT over allegations of land grabbing, deforestation and human rights violations related to its palm oil and rubber plantations. Martinez Blanco emphasizes the concept of "loss and damage," criticizing the newly established loss and damage fund for its lack of adequate support from developed countries. He also critiques Paragraph 51 of the Paris Agreement, which allows industrialized nations to evade accountability for climate-related harms, complicating efforts to secure reparations and address the realities of vulnerable communities. The conversation highlights the urgent need for a robust international legal framework to effectively address climate change and protect affected communities. Martinez Blanco stresses the importance of climate litigation as a tool for holding Global North states and corporations accountable for perpetrating environmental crimes and damages. He calls for unity amongst Global South countries to adopt a rights-based position in negotiations, focusing on specific reparations rather than diluting the conversation into broader concepts. Despite challenges such as limited resources, risks and threats faced by environmental defenders, Martinez Blanco advocates for pragmatic approaches rooted in human rights to address climate change impacts, underscoring that the lived experiences of affected communities should be central to climate justice negotiations. </p>  <p>   <br>Adrián Martinez Blanco, MA, is the Director of  La Ruta del Clima , a Costa Rican NGO that promotes public participation in climate and environmental decision-making and has been an observer, advocating at the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC) climate summits since 2014. Adrián’s research areas include climate impacts, loss and damage, human rights, public participation and international climate law. He is a current PhD candidate at the University of Eastern Finland and holds a Master's degree in  Environment, Development and Peace  with a speciality in climate public policies. Patrick Toussaint is an international lawyer, policy analyst, and researcher with over eight years of experience in international environmental law and policy. He specializes in critical areas such as climate change, biodiversity, and air pollution. In addition to his legal expertise, Patrick excels as a communicator and facilitator, demonstrating a strong commitment to promoting diversity, mediation, and conflict resolution in his work.</p>
