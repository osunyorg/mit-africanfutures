biography: >-
  <p>Maureen’s work is dedicated to dismantling the exploitative structures of our digital ecosystem. Her aim is to challenge the myth that digital spaces are inherently democratic, instead exposing how data extraction and "market interests" often mirror and amplify real-world inequalities.</p><p>Through the Digital Rights Mtaani (DRIM) project, Maureen bridges the gap between digital rights and community organizing. By focusing on the impacts of AI and "Tech Feudalism," she leads collective efforts to document and share how marginalized Kenyan communities; often excluded due to class, gender, sexuality, or disability - navigate a web of surveillance and extraction. Maureen’s mission is to reclaim the digital sphere as a site of true liberation and collective knowledge-building.</p>
