biography: >-
  <p>Samira is a storyteller, campaigner, and activist from Mayotte dedicated to centering Afro-descendant communities in the global climate discourse. Through her initiative <b><i>Amani Yatru ("Our Common Good")</i></b>, Samira frames climate action as a foundational act of political and cultural resistance. By leveraging her expertise in international environmental law, she challenges the systemic exclusion of French "overseas territories" from environmental justice conversations. Samira’s work is a powerful blend of narrative and law, aimed at building a collective movement for liberation, reparation, and the protection of her home island’s future.  </p>
