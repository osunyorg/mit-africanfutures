    <p>At African Futures Lab, we believe that racial injustice is not a relic of the past but rather, it is a system still shaping the present.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Across Africa and Europe, Black and Afro-descendant communities continue to face the consequences of colonialism, economic exploitation, environmental harm, and social erasure. Yet the silence around these injustices remains deafening. Powerholders deny accountability. Public debate avoids the roots of inequality. And those who dare to act often feel alone. We created AFaLab to change that. Through transformative research, cross-continental mobilization, and bold alliance-building, we work to make global racial injustice visible—and to dismantle it. Our Mobilization Labs (MobLabs) bring together historians, activists, economists, artists, and lawyers to design the campaigns and reforms that power real change. Our policy papers challenge denial. Our events amplify marginalized voices. Our movement grows stronger every day. But we can't do this without you. Your donation helps us:  <br> Produce research that centers truth and lived experience.  <br> Train and support advocates across Africa and Europe.  <br> Sustain our independence from political or corporate influence.  <br> Build a future where dignity, reparations, and justice are non-negotiable.  <br> If you believe that another world is possible—help us build</p>  <p>   <br> Support African Futures Lab today and be part of the change.  </p>  <p>Donate via paypal <br>https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/africanfutureslab</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Donate via wire funds to the African Futures Lab’s depository account:    <br>  <br> Account  : BE 64 3632  2413  9152   <br>  <br> BIC  : BBRUBEBB  <br>  <br> Address : Boulevard de l'Empereur 10,1000  <br>  <br> City : Brussels  <br>  <br> E-mail : info@afalab.org  <br>  <br> Receiving Bank : ING  <br> To the account of: African Futures Lab   <br> REFERENCE/ COMMUNICATION : Name of donor / Name of sending organization or foundation + “donationAfaLab2025”.
