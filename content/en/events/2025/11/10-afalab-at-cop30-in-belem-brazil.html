    AfaLab at COP30 in Belém, Brazil
  summary: >-
    
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The countdown is on. This November, world leaders will gather in the Brazilian Amazon for the 2025 UN Climate Change Conference (COP30), with what many are describing as the first “Reparations” COP following the landmark advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice. The world is watching, and so are we.  <br> AfaLab will be in Belém for the conference, and we are looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and organizations to amplify African voices on climate reparations and strike new alliances with allies from across the regions, including Afro-descendant communities and the diaspora!  <br> If you will be in Belém and are interested in partnering, get in touch with us. Email us at info@afalab.org</p>
