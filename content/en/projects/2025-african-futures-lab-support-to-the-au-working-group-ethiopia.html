    <p>  African Futures Lab support to the African Union ECOSOCC Climate Change Working Group (CCWG)    </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>African Futures Lab has been selected to be part of the African Union Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC) Climate Change Working Group (CCWG). This working group will advise ECOSSOC and other AU bodies on climate policy, contributing to policy documents, building capacity, and leading inclusive consultations.  <br> This is the chance for African Futures Lab to shape regional discussions on African climate justice and reparations, directly aligning with the AU's theme for the year: "Justice for Africans and people of African Descent through reparations."  <br> Key Activities with the Climate Change Working Group (CCWG)  <br> •	Develop actionable policy recommendations on climate finance <br> •	Engage in COP30 preparations to ensure African priorities are reflected in discussions.  <br> •	Organize webinars, workshops, and events to strengthen civil society’s engagement.  <br> •	Conduct research to support evidence-based advocacy at COP30.  <br> African Futures Lab’s participation will ensure that AU climate policies are informed by rigorous, empirically based knowledge, which is a hallmark of the African Futures Lab's approach. </p>
