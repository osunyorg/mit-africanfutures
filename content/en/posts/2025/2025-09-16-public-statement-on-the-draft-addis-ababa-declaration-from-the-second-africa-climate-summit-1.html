    Public Statement on the Draft Addis Ababa Declaration from the Second Africa Climate Summit
  summary: >-
    <p>This statement serves as our voice, communicating our values and our commitment to justice, on the Addis Ababa Declaration on Climate Change and Call to Action.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The Draft Addis Ababa Declaration, adopted at the Second Africa <br>Climate Summit (ACS2) in Addis Ababa last week, is put forward as a continental <br>blueprint for green transformation. It emphasizes Africa's potential to lead in <br>renewable energy, innovation, and resilience. With the launch of the Africa <br>Climate Innovation Compact, the Declaration commits to mobilizing 1,000 <br>African-led climate solutions by 2030 and the establishment of an African <br>Climate Facility to leverage US$50 billion annually in catalytic climate finance. <br>It highlights nature-based solutions such as the Great Green Wall and <br>Ethiopia's Green Legacy Initiative as part of Africa's ecological response.  </p>  <p>The political commitments <br>reflected in the Addis Declaration seek to shift the narrative from Africa as <br>primarily a site of vulnerability to a continent that asserts its agency in <br>shaping climate solutions. Energy infrastructure, just transition pathways, adaptation measures, <br>and the new Green Minerals Strategy all speak to a more proactive, Africa-centered <br>climate agenda.  The insistence that climate finance is a legal obligation <br>under the UNFCCC, not charity, is a crucial step forward.  <br>  <br>While Addis <br>sharpens Africa's call for finance, innovation, and systemic reform, its <br>ambition is undercut in two ways: first, a retreat from the stronger language on <br>fossil fuels in the Nairobi Declaration of the First African Climate Summit in <br>2023, dropping commitments to phase down unabated coal and end subsidies, and <br>instead stressing "transitional energy sources" and "national contexts"—a <br>softening that prolongs extractive dependence. Secondly, the declaration omits <br>reparations as a key vehicle of delivering transformative climate justice for <br>Africa, even as the global legal and political momentum for reparative justice <br>grows.   </p>  <p>Ambition without reckoning is insufficient. African <br>leaders present at the summit missed the opportunity to use this declaration <br>to firmly situate Africa's demands within the framework of climate reparations—especiallyt a moment when the African Union has designated 2025 the Year of <br>Reparations and launched a Decade of Reparations running through 2036. Climate <br>reparations are absent, even as the world enters a new era of legal <br>recognition: the International Court of Justice, the Inter-American Court of <br>Human Rights, and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea have all <br>issued advisory opinions  affirming states' legalduties to prevent and remedy climate harm . A  petition  is also before the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights, offering Africa the chance to assert reparations as a continental <br>demand grounded in its own legal and institutional frameworks. </p>  <p>In our webinar " From Courts to COP: Harnessing Legal <br>Momentum for African Climate Reparations,"  hosted jointly by African Futures Lab, AU <br>ECOSOCC, and Biophilic Conversations on 25 August, African jurists and civil <br>society advocates underscored that reparations are no longer an abstract demand <br>but a legal and political imperative. <br>  <br>The omission <br>matters. Africa's position at COP30 in Belém will be stronger if rooted not <br>only in calls for fair financing and systemic reform but also in a clear <br>recognition that  reparations are owed . Reparative justice requires <br>moving beyond concessional loans, incremental pledges, and vague commitments toward concrete measures of restitution, compensation, and structural <br>transformation. <br>  <br>There are additional <br>risks. Without robust accountability and monitoring mechanisms, Addis's commitments, such <br>as the $50 billion in annual finance, risk remaining aspirational. It is unclear <br>how communities will be able to track delivery, audit progress, or hold leaders <br>and institutions accountable. Moreover, without safeguards, there is a danger <br>that benefits will be   captured by larger economies and elites within <br>Africa, leaving vulnerable states, smallholder farmers, indigenous peoples, <br>women, and youth behind. Reparations logic demands equity  within  as well <br>as  beyond  Africa. This requires ensuring an equitable distribution of <br>benefits across the continent, with special measures for LDCs, SIDS, indigenous <br>peoples, women, and youth. <br>  <br>Furthermore, while <br>Addis calls for reform of the international finance architecture—from debt and tax frameworks to MDB governance and accessibility of climate finance—it does so <br>largely within the parameters of existing institutions. What remains missing is <br>a bolder articulation of African-led alternatives that move beyond reform at <br>the margins. Reparative justice requires improving access within current systems and reimagining  global economic governance to <br>address structural injustices .  </p>  <p>Momentum for this shift is growing elsewhere. <br>At the  Second Africa-CARICOM Summit ,   held on 7 September 2025, <br>leaders from African nations and Caribbean states, and representatives from the <br>global African diaspora, affirmed that reparations can <br>be most effectively pursued through transcontinental partnership. Leaders <br>stressed the need for Africa and the Caribbean to speak with one voice on the <br>international stage, linking demands for reparations to reform of global <br>financial and multilateral institutions, and grounding this agenda in <br>Pan-African ideals. With CARICOM's Reparations Commission at the forefront, the <br>summit underscored that reparations are not symbolic but essential to <br>addressing the legacies of slavery, colonialism, and structural inequality. <br>  <br>The Addis Ababa <br>Declaration should therefore be read in two registers. It marks some progress: <br>a sign that Africa will not wait to be "supported" but will lead with <br>innovation and resilience. But it also leaves the most urgent demand - reparations <br>- unanswered.  Without reparations at the core, Africa risks once again <br>shouldering the costs of global ambition while being denied redress for the <br>historical and ongoing harms it has suffered . <br>  <br>African Futures Lab calls on <br>African leaders to ensure that at COP30 and beyond, the African position <br>advances reparations as the principle that ties together finance, adaptation, <br>energy security, and climate justice. As the declaration rightly notes, climate <br>finance is not charity. Financing Africa's climate futures should not be framed <br>as aid or investment opportunity, but as reparations rooted in the colonial <br>past and present, compelled by law, and demanded by justice.</p>  <p> What we advocate for:  <br>   <br>   <br> Embedding reparations in climate finance architecture:  Recognizing that climate finance for Africa must be <br>     framed not as aid or investment but as reparations, with binding <br>     obligations on historic polluters.  <br>   <br> Operationalizing restitution for loss and damage:  Ensuring the Loss and Damage Fund provides significantly <br>     upscaled, direct, grant-based access for African states and communities, including <br>     for non-economic losses and climate-induced mobility.  <br>   <br> Advancing AU-CARICOM alignment:  Building <br>     towards a joint Africa-Caribbean reparations platform to strengthen <br>     negotiating leverage at COP30 and beyond.  <br>  </p>  <p> Shifting <br>from extraction to transformation:  Implementing  the Green Minerals Strategy <br>with safeguards for communities, value addition on the continent, and strict <br>accountability to avoid repeating colonial patterns of raw resource export.      <br>   <br> Anchoring adaptation in justice:  Making adaptation a central part of just transition <br>     strategies, ensuring resources reach smallholder farmers, women, youth, <br>     and frontline communities.  <br>   <br> Ensuring accountability and transparency:  Establishing independent monitoring and participatory <br>     mechanisms, including African civil society oversight, to track delivery of <br>     finance, innovation, and just transition commitments.  <br> </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>   <br>Addis Ababa Declaration on Climate Change and Call to Action</p>  <p>AfaLab Statement on ACS2 Addis Ababa Declaration</p>
