    <p>How has your work engaged issues of racial justice and reparations?  <br>   <br>My tenure as head of the Truth & Dignity Commission (Instance Vérité Dignité, IVD) was at the heart of issues related to reparations for victims of violations, including racial discrimination in Tunisian society.  The IVD received collective complaints from Black and Amazigh minority populations. Investigations revealed discriminatory policies on the part of public authorities, and the IVD recommended that these two groups receive reparations as a result. The IVD also issued 5 recommendations relating to these two groups to the Tunisian state in its final report: 1. Protect the existence of minorities and combat all forms of racial discrimination; 2. Guarantee minorities’ right to a distinct identity, the right to participate in decision-making and equal access to decision-making positions, the right to practice their culture, and the right to learn their mother tongue; 3. Combat hate speech and all ideas or theories based on racial superiority or hatred; 4. Act to reduce the social stigmatization suffered by these persons; 5. Take all necessary measures at the legislative and regulatory levels to prevent discrimination in obtaining and keeping a job on the basis of race or color. The IVD also addressed the colonial legacy and racial discrimination practiced by colonial France against Tunisians, who were considered an inferior race. A memorandum was sent in 2019 to the French state demanding reparation for damages suffered. Our investigations challenged the myth of the "civilizing" mission of France. For example, the historian Charles André Julien mentions in his book,  Colons français et Jeunes Tunisiens , the policies aimed at keeping Tunisian children illiterate. He says in particular: "From 4,656 in 1897, the number of Muslim schoolchildren gradually dropped to 2,927 in 1903. In 1901, ten schools were closed. The point of view of the educational establishment joined that of the colonists, whose goal was to rehabilitate the  Kouttab  (Koranic school), which French Tunisia deemed perfectly adapted to natives."</p>  <p> To what extent do you work with individuals or groups with different expertise or training than your own?  <br>   <br>Because of its mission, the IVD brought together a wide range of disciplines and specialists who worked together to better understand the issues related to its mandate. These included lawyers, psychologists, social workers, doctors, historians, archivists, communicators, judges, sociologists, statisticians... The synergies of these experts from different backgrounds made possible new insights into the issues the commission addressed. Further, participants stated that the experience was very enriching for them as it allowed them to open their horizons to perspectives never before considered.</p>  <p> What is the future you are working towards in your work?  <br>   <br>The IVD produced a final report in Arabic, a summary of which has been translated into  French  and  English . It has also released a  documentary  on its mandate titled,  The Tunisian experience in transitional justice . Along with some colleagues, I also recently created the association  Mémoire et citoyenneté  (Memory and Citizenship). The association’s objective is to collect all documentation relating to Tunisians' memory relating to violence and violations against citizens, from colonization to the present day, to make this documentation available to researchers, journalists, students, as well as the general public. To promote acts of resistance and a culture of political action. To stimulate reflection on the importance of respect for human dignity and the values of coexistence and mutual respect so that violations are not trivialized and do not recur. <br>To learn more about Sihem's work: Documentary about the Truth & Dignity Commission (IVD):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxaAPQSNzCg&authuser=0 Truth & Dignity Commission memorandum to France on the subject of reparations (2019) Truth & Dignity Commission report ( FR , ENG )</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Sihem Benseddrine handing a ruling on reparations to a Tunisian veteran victim of violence under French colonial rule </p>
