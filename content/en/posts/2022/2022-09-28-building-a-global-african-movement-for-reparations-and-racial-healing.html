    Building a Global African movement for reparations and racial healing

    <p>Season I Episode 2 - Makmid Kamara & Amara Enyia</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>In this episode of  Future Perfect | Futur Antérieur , we welcome Dr. Amara Enyia, President of Global Black, and Makmid Kamara, Executive Director of the Africa Transitional Justice Fund (ATJLF). ATJLF convened the recent  Accra Summit on Reparations and Racial Healing  (August 2022), a gathering that brought together activists, policymakers, and foundations to start establishing a common agenda for reparations that centers the African continent. The Accra Summit built on the  Reparations and Healing Convening , a weeklong meeting of reparations and healing experts hosted by Nicole Hannah Jones and facilitated by Dr. Enyia in Bellagio, Italy in July 2022. The Convening’s aim was to address the legacies of the Transatlantic slave trade and develop collective strategies for achieving redress and repair.  In this conversation,  Makmid and Amara  share the motivations for and outcomes of these two gatherings as part of a broader movement underway for achieving reparatory justice and healing for Africans around the world. Along the way, they talk to us about why reparations is not solely about the past, but rather is a future-making, world-building project, and why imagination must be a cornerstone of efforts to address historical crimes and their legacies.  Read the  Accra Declaration on Reparations and Racial Healing , a key outcome of the Accra Summit  here . ** Dr Amara Enyia  is a US-based Strategist, Public Policy Expert and Social Impact professional on city and state policy as well as international affairs with expertise in Africa, Latin America, and Central Asia. In addition to her role as President of transnational advocacy organization Global Black, Dr. Enyia serves as Chairwoman of the International Working Group for the United Nations Permanent Forum on People of African Descent, and as Manager of Policy & Research for the Movement for Black Lives. Prior to her current roles, she worked in the Mayor’s Office for the City of Chicago, served as Executive Director of community-based organizations, and, as a grassroots organizer, worked on issues of education equity, economic justice, and environmental justice. Dr. Enyia holds Bachelors degrees in Journalism and Political Science, Masters degrees in Education and in Cities from the London School of Economics, a law degree, and a PhD in Education Policy. Learn more about Dr. Enyia’s work  here Makmid Kamara  is Director of the  Africa Transitional Justice Legacy Fund  (ATJLF), which is based in Accra, Ghana. Makmid is a human rights leader, researcher and development communications practitioner, with almost twenty years’ experience working with national and international development and human rights organisations in various countries, including Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and the United Kingdom.
