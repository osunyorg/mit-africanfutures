    <p>  <br>In recent years, some European countries have started returning looted works of art and ancestral remains to former colonies.</p>  <p>   <br>While it is a commendable effort, these European-led initiatives often marginalize stakeholders from formerly colonized nations and limit their involvement in the process. Therefore, these initiatives often perpetuate the colonial violence they are trying to correct.</p>  <p>   <br>Our team monitors these processes to expose their colonial continuities.</p>
