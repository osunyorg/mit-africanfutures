        <p>“Once upon a time — In just 50 years, we will have dismantled the global system of racial domination. What was once a banal, unquestioned status quo — where the lives of African and Afro-descendant people were devalued and oppression normalized — will be nothing more than a distant memory.</p>
        <p>Instead, our dignity and rights will not only be protected but celebrated. We will be honored for the sacrifices we made to bring humanity to this pivotal moment, and we will receive the compassionate political and social support we deserve, around the world.”</p>

      notes: >-
        
        <p>This future may sound utopian today, but every action—big or small—and the unwavering solidarity of our community make it possible.</p>
