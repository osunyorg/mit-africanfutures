    <p>  <br>As the African Union enters its Decade on Reparations, African Futures Lab works with the  African Union Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC)  Climate Change Working Group to push for climate action rooted in justice, accountability, and historical responsibility. In 2025 the Working Group has produced several outputs, including a policy brief on African priorities ahead of COP30 and seven position papers on mitigation, adaptation, and climate finance.  Our Lab leads the Climate Finance Workstream, chaired by  Dr. Patrick Toussaint . Under this workstream, we contributed three position papers, including as lead author of a paper on  Advancing Climate Reparations, Human Rights, and Gender Justice Through Climate Finance.  This position paper reveals how climate finance frameworks reduce justice questions to technical procedures, leaving African communities outside the rooms where decisions are made. This analysis forms part of a wider pattern in which administrative tools overshadow structural redistribution, historical responsibility, and the lived experiences of climate-vulnerable populations.
