    Festival "Wakati Wetu" It's our time for reparations (Kenya)
  summary: >-
    <p>Wakati Wetu is a 2-day cultural festival in Nairobi igniting global conversations on reparative justice through art, activism, and community, in response to the African Union’s Year of Justice.</p>

    <p>  <br>Wakati Wetu Reparations Festival <br> Dates: 22–23 October 2025 <br> Location: Entim Sidai, Nairobi, Kenya</p>  <p> Context and Rationale  <br>   <br>"Art plays a crucial role in shaping and renewing culture: it can shine a spotlight on truth, create moments of joy, or inspire us to act. In times like these, we need to empower artists like never before to help us reflect, to rekindle our hope, and to imagine a better future,” Tim Jones, Founder of Artscape.  <br> We, the partners of this reparatory justice collective, agree with Jones’ sentiments above. We believe that the reparations and racial justice movements in Africa have severely underutilized the power of arts and culture in the ongoing campaign. For the past several years, the interactions between the arts and culture community and the traditional CSO/NGO community on the reparations campaign have been short-lived, haphazard, and piecemeal. The reparations discussions have been siloed and not adequately socialised. It is for this and other reasons that we are organizing the reparations festival titled  WAKATI WETU: It’s Our Time -  to resist, repair & reclaim.  <br> This festival aims to re-ignite and facilitate the process of reimagining a repaired Africa. This involves bringing together African youth, activists, feminists, community activists, and climate justice advocates, as well as practitioners from global Africa to envision and build a future free of racial violence and rooted in black renaissance. It will be a space for collective imagination, strategic recalibration, and repairing the movements’ collective connections with the public alongside arts and culture. <br> The continent is awash with a plethora of advocates, policymakers, movement lawyers, artists, artivists, cultural chemists, content creators and curators, storytellers, and visioners. Together, we intend to weave together a web of creativity that could produce a vibrant tapestry of society. However, the reparations movement on the continent has failed to delve into the profound impact that the intersections of traditional campaigning and art and culture could have on shaping our collective consciousness.   <br> With the goal of making Africa the epicenter of demands for justice and reparations while strengthening alliances between the diaspora and the people of the continent, this festival will be organized in Nairobi.  <br> It will be the start of a 10-year process, alongside the African Union’s (AU) Decade of Reparations. It is also an opportunity for the NGO community to utilize arts, culture, and innovation in the reparations campaign. It will serve as a dynamic platform to mobilize the public and ignite active engagement across all sectors of society in a powerful call for reimagining a future based on reparative justice, dignity, and equity. </p>
