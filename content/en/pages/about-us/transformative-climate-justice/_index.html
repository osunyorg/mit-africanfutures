    <p>From Repair towards Just and Equitable Futures for Africans and Afro-descendants  <br>   <br>The climate crisis is not just an ecological crisis – it is a racial justice crisis. It is the consequence of centuries of colonial extraction, land dispossession, and racial domination. Built on slavery, forced labour, land theft, and the plunder of African resources, the carbon-intensive world we inhabit today was shaped by systems that treated African lives and lands as expendable – all justified through racial ideologies that dehumanized African peoples and treated their lands as expendable. Africa did not create this crisis, but it suffers its most brutal consequences. The global climate agenda remains heavily influenced by Global North institutions and interests, often sidelining the perspectives and needs of communities on the frontlines of the crisis.  Under the banner of green growth and sustainable development, climate action is structured around around carbon markets and donor agendas, reinforcing the same colonial patterns of control, dependency, and dispossession. From cobalt mines in the DRC to hydrogen ventures in Namibia, African lands and labour are again being sacrificed, this time to fuel energy transitions in the Global North. Over thirty years of UN climate negotiations have failed to address this reality. There has been no meaningful engagement with historical responsibility, no tangible redress for climate loss and damage. If we do not act, the world’s biggest polluters will continue to emit, profit, and delay real action, at the cost of African lives and futures.  If a system is broken, it needs to be repaired. At African Futures Lab, we view climate reparations as a response to historical and ongoing harms – and a transformative opportunity to dismantle neo-colonial structures, empower African communities and movements - in particular Black women -, and reshape global solutions around African demands and leadership. Confronting these structural injustices is essential to securing real accountability and redistributing power in the fight for a just climate future.</p>
