  <p>Shaany N’sondé joined AfaLab’s team as Program Administrator in 2023. She supports the Lab in the areas of communications, administration, and project implementation. Shaany comes from a dual cultural background (France and the Republic of Congo), and holds a Bachelor's degree in History from the University Paris-Sorbonne, as well as a Masters in Political Science and International Relations from the Free University of Brussels. After working on a project that aimed to decolonize the Free University of Brussel's colonial legacy, Shaany completed her Masters thesis on movements to decolonize the public space in Brussels. Most recently, before joining AfaLab, Shaany worked for the Africa-Europe Diaspora Development Platform on projects concerning the role of the African diaspora in migration and international development policies. </p>
