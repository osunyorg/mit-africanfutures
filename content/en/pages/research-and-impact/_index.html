    <p>  <br>The research reports and policy papers are action-oriented: Ideas and knowledge inform public discussions and guide decision-makers in their efforts to undertake reform. Recognizing that the production of knowledge is profoundly political, our research methodology centers historically marginalized voices, based on race, nationality, gender, religion, ability, or other factors. Our research methodology takes a cross-disciplinary approach: We value a wide range of expertise and we invite as many different voices to the table as possible. We believe that expanding the proverbial table strengthens the work.</p>  <p> Key figures </p>  <p>Current Projects <br>dedicated to the themes of gender and reparations, climate justice, financial responsibility, restitution of heritage and broader restorative justice</p>  <p>Current Campaigns <br>dedicated to the themes of gender and reparations, climate justice, financial responsibility, restitution of heritage and broader restorative justice</p>  <p>Funding Projects <br>Co-creative laboratory for research, investigations and debates around our favorite themes.</p>  <p> Current Projects  <br>   <br>Our current projects explore how colonial and racial domination shape current global systems.
