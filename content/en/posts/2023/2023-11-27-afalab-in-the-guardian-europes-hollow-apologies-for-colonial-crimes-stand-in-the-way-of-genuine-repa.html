    <p>  <br>We are thrilled to share with you  AfaLab Executive Director Liliane Umubyeyi's article in The Guardian  on Europe's approach to apologies and regrets for colonial crimes and slavery.</p>  <p>   <br>The article criticizes what is described as a "divide and conquer" approach employed by former colonial powers, and argues that this method undermines genuine efforts to seek justice and reparations. The article's themes resonate with the themes and findings of our series of research reports on reparations.</p>
