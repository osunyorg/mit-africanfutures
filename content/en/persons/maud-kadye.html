biography: >-
  <p>Maud is the founder of<i><b> Beyond Aid Narratives</b></i>, a decolonial communications initiative dedicated to dismantling the "white savior" industrial complex within the global development sector. Her work shifts the power of narrative production away from external organizations and back to the African and diaspora communities who own these stories. By providing ethical communication training and disrupting colonial imagery, Maud is building a pan-African network of storytellers equipped to reshape development discourse from the inside out. Her project serves as a critical intervention against extractive volunteering, advocating instead for narrative sovereignty and structural change.</p>
