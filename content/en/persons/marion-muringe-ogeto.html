biography: >-
  <p>Marion Muringe Ogeto is a human rights lawyer and Gender Justice Specialist from Kenya with over five years experience working on gender justice in Africa in various organizations such as Equality Now. She holds an LLM from Columbia Law School where she was a Human Rights Fellow, and is an Advocate of the High Court of Kenya.   </p><p>Her project, <i><b>Reimagining Transitional Justice</b></i>, challenges traditional post-conflict models by addressing the persistent structural violence of colonialism. Marion investigates how colonial regimes codified gender inequality into African legal systems - norms that continue to marginalize women today.  Drawing on Pan-African feminist legal analysis, Marion develops a reparative framework that moves beyond symbolic justice toward institutional transformation, historical accountability, and gender-responsive reparations.   </p>
