    <p>Why COP30 is a Defining Moment for Africa  <br>   <br>African nations contribute less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions yet face widespread devastation. Communities and states across the continent are bearing the full brunt of the crisis,  through worsening desertification, heatwaves, floods, droughts, and the destruction of biodiversity . On a human and economic level, the losses caused by extreme climate events are enormous, reaching up to 5% of annual GDP in some African nations, while the estimated financial needs to respond lie  between 187 and 359 billion US dollars annually . Meanwhile Africa receives only a small fraction of climate finance needed, often in the form of debt-creating loans. This disparity is an unfair, direct violation of basic human rights and a continuation of structural injustice. African Futures Lab will be on the ground at COP30 in Belém, Brazil; an Afro-descendant and Amazonian city to advance an African-led vision of climate justice . The climate crisis is rooted in colonial extraction, racialized exploitation, and structural inequality, yet all too often this reality is invisibilized in the negotiations and in global climate action.  Our work at COP30 aims to shift the global climate narrative from one of aid and charity to one of structural transformation rooted in reparative justice.  We see COP30 as a pivotal space to connect African struggles with those of Afro-descendant and Indigenous peoples across Latin America, the Caribbean, and the broader Global South. Together, these movements can amplify calls for accountability, solidarity, and systemic change.</p>  <p>International Court of Justice <br> Our Core Demands For COP30  <br> Our work at COP30 and beyond is guided by four pillars:  <br>i) Advocate for Climate Reparations We promote the recognition of the historical and present-day climate injustices against Africa and push for reparative financial and policy mechanisms from major polluters—governments and corporations alike. Climate debt must be acknowledged and paid. ii) Challenge Unjust Climate Finance Systems We challenge unjust climate finance systems—including IMF and World Bank loan structures, and carbon markets—that reinforce neo-colonial dependency. We advocate for unconditional grants, equitable loss and damage frameworks, and human rights-based approaches. iii) Empower African Communities and Movements We amplify the voices of African frontline communities and African civil society movements by securing resources, legal support, and policy influence, and facilitate knowledge-sharing across the Global South. Our approach emphasizes inclusive leadership, especially by women affected by the climate crisis. Through media, storytelling, and public advocacy, we aim to reframe climate justice debates around African demands, histories, and leadership. We challenge technical and market-based framings and elevate structural, anti-colonial perspectives. iv) Build Alliances and Strategic Partnerships We aim to strengthen ties with African, Caribbean, Latin American, and Global South movements to forge a united front for climate reparations rooted in solidarity and mutual accountability.</p>  <p>International Court of Justice <br> The Legal Momentum We Are Leveraging  <br> The legal terrain has shifted in 2025, making climate justice a matter of non-negotiable legal obligation.  <br>The International Court of Justice (ICJ)  affirmed that high-emitting states have binding legal duties regarding the climate crisis. This verdict transforms our demands into non-negotiable obligations, providing powerful leverage for compensation, capacity-building, and technology transfer. African states must coordinate and assert their rights by translating these opinions into non-negotiable demands at COP30.  Read more about what the ICJ's Advisory Opinion means for Africa in our Op-ed.</p>  <p>International Court of Justice <br>   <br>The pending advisory opinion from the  African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights (AfCHPR)  can help define the scope of African States’ duties to protect their peoples and ecosystems from climate harm, particularly the polluting activities of transnational oil & gas corporations—reinforcing Africa’s own legal architecture for climate accountability.  We recently convened a webinar on harnessing this legal momentum, including the AfCHPR for climate reparations.</p>  <p>African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights <br> Our Team At COP30  <br>  </p>  <p>Here is an overview of the team's expertise at COP30. Patrick  brings legal expertise on reparations and loss and damage, negotiation tracking, and will oversee the Lab’s engagement with civil society partners on the ground. Lavender  brings strong networks acrossAfrican movements, experience in narrative shaping, and a strong voice on the intersection of gender and reparations. Hélène  leads coordination across African and transcontinental networks, bridging English- and French-speaking movements and strengthening South-South alliances. Hélène is also fluent in Portuguese.</p>  <p>Research & Policy Advisor.</p>  <p>Strategic Campaigner.</p>  <p>Partnerships & Advocacy Officer.</p>  <p> Join Us   <br>   <br>Our activities at COP30 in the fight for climate reparations</p>  <p> Attending COP30 in person?  <br>Our colleagues will be speaking in events across the blue zone, green zone and civil society spaces around Belém.
