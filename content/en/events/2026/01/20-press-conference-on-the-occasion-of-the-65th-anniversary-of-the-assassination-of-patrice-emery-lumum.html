    Press Conference on the occasion of the 65th anniversary of the assassination of Patrice Émery Lumumba

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>On 20 January 2026, three days after the 65th anniversary of the assassination of Patrice Émery Lumumba, the Belgian justice system will hold a decisive hearing to determine whether criminal proceedings related to his death and those of Maurice Mpolo and Joseph Okito, will proceed. At this stage of the proceedings, Étienne Davignon remains the last surviving indicted individual in this case, making this hearing a potentially final opportunity for a Belgian court to examine individual criminal responsibility for a major colonial crime. On this symbolic date, African Futures Lab, together with European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), will attend and support the press conference held by Jus Cogens Law Firm and the Lumumba family, reaffirming the importance of truth, accountability, and justice as foundations for meaningful repair. Join us next tuesday, in Brussels or online, to follow this important moment. The press conference will be held in French and English. 📍 Hybrid: Press Club Brussels Europe (95 Rue Froissart, 1040 Brussels) &  Press Club Brussels Europe’s YouTube channel   🗓️ Tuesday, 20 January 2026 | 2PM CET ℹ️ More info: mlhd@juscogens.be | lm@juscogens.be</p>

meta_description: >-
  ixty-five years after the assassination of Patrice Émery Lumumba, the first  democratically elected Prime Minister of independent Congo, Étienne Davignon  remains the last surviving indicted individual in this case. With the hearing that will  decide whether the criminal trial will take place approaching on 20 January in Brussels,  the Lumumba family asserts that this is likely the last opportunity for the Belgian justice  system to ‘give truth a chance’ and to rule on criminal responsibilities for the war crimes  that led to the death of Patrice Lumumba on 17 January 1961. Refusing such judicial  scrutiny would definitely entrench the impunity for major colonial crimes.
