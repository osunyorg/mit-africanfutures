    <p>  <br>2–3 June 2025, University of Pretoria (Hybrid) | Advancing Climate Reparations at Pretoria Conference   <br>As the African Union marks 2025 as the Year of Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations, African Futures Lab joined the Justice through Reparations: African–Caribbean Dialogue hosted by the University of Pretoria. The two-day conference brought together experts from across Africa and the Caribbean to advance the fight for reparations for historical harms rooted in slavery, colonialism, and environmental exploitation.  <br> Our Climate Research and Policy Advisor, Dr. Patrick Toussaint, joined virtually to present the joint paper: "Climate Reparations and the Continuing Legacies of Colonial Harm: Developing a Pan-African Research and Policy Agenda."  <br> The paper argues that the climate crisis is a racial justice issue, rooted in extractive colonial histories, and calls for a Pan-African research and policy framework for climate reparations.  <br> Organized by CARICOM, UN Permanent Forum on People of African Descent, and others.  <br> •  Visit the official official event page.</p>  <p>30 May 2025 | Landmark Climate Ruling: Saul Lliuya v RWE    <br>African Futures Lab analyzed the recent verdict in Saul Lliuya vs RWE, a major step forward in climate litigation and corporate accountability.

Key Takeaways from the Convening - Africa’s climate crisis is rooted in colonial extraction and unjust global systems.  <br> - False solutions like carbon markets and geoengineering risk deepening harm — African communities need homegrown, feminist, community-led solutions, not copy-paste models from the Global North.  <br> - 22 African countries face debt distress — our movements must connect climate, economic, and debt justice.  <br> - Food and health systems are under pressure — agroecology and public systems are critical pathways forward.  <br> - Climate finance must stop propping up fossil fuels and start funding frontline-led transitions.  <br> - Intersectionality is not optional — we must center race, gender, youth, and disability justice in all we do.  <br> This convening was a reminder that movements across the continent are not only resisting — we are reimagining and rebuilding systems rooted in justice, solidarity, and care</p>  <p>5 May 2025 | Blog article by Dr. Patrick Toussaint titled 'Loss and Damage, Liability and the Case for Reparations'   <br>In this insightful  blog post  on the Environmental Law and Justice Blog, Dr. Toussaint unpacks the case for reparations through the lens of loss and damage, legal liability, and climate justice frameworks. •  Read the blog article.</p>  <p>April 2025 | African Futures Lab Presents at Montreal Climate Reparations Conference  <br>At the Montreal Climate Reparations Conference, Dr. Toussaint presented on the climate justice implications of US superfund models and the case for strict liability instruments that center the rights of Global South communities in loss and damage financing.</p>
