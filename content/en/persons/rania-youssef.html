biography: >-
  <p>Rania is a developer and the founder of Tribe-X, a decolonial tech initiative designed to dismantle the dominance of Big Tech and Eurocentric digital standards. By creating self-hosted, privacy-focused tools like the Kenzy app, Rania is building infrastructures that prioritize data ownership for non-technical users in the Global South. Her work at the African Futures Lab focuses on developing a decolonial tech curriculum and an ethical audit framework, allowing communities to assess and resist platform capitalism. Rania’s mission is to move away from extractive digital systems toward architectures built on ethics, inclusivity, and intersectionality.</p>
