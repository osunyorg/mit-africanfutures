    <p>  <br>On 21 August, our Executive Director, Liliane Umubyeyi, was featured in an  interview with Le Monde  (a French newspaper), where she called for a decisive shift from the outdated “aid” model toward a paradigm of reparations. She highlighted how Africa’s structural inequalities rooted in colonial extraction and systemic dispossession - demand bold, justice-driven solutions rather than temporary fixes.   <br> In the interview, she sees the recent freezing of U.S. development aid as a critical opportunity to demand an overhaul of the international cooperation ecosystem, exposing the flaws in aid institutions that often fail to genuinely foster Africa's development.  <br> Liliane underscores that reparations are not charity but a right grounded in history, law, and morality. She makes the case for reimagining Africa’s role in shaping global governance and advancing new systems that restore dignity and autonomy.</p>  <p> Highlights of the interview  </p>
