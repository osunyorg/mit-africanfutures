biography: >-
  <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakshita-kanhiya-127977199/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lakshita <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> is an Indo-Mauritian scholar-activist dedicated to advancing a rights-based reparative justice framework for the Creole community. Her work builds on the unfinished mandate of the Mauritian Truth and Justice Commission (TJC) -<b> t</b><b>he first in the world to investigate the legacies of both slavery and indentured labor</b>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakshita-kanhiya-127977199/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Lakshita <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>’s project interrogates how historical land dispossession and socio-economic marginalization continue to shape modern Mauritius. By critically revisiting the TJC’s unimplemented recommendations, she challenges state-led erasures and advocates for structural transformations, including land reform and education-based reparations. Her research repositions the Indian Ocean as a vital, often overlooked geography in the global struggle for racial equity and decolonial justice. </p>
