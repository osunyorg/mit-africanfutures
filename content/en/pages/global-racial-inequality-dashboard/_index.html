      <p> In the last few years, we have witnessed an unrelenting race in the <br>development of  new technologies  that govern our socio-political, <br>economic, and cultural worlds.Racial justice actors and scholars have <br>extensively demonstrated the  racial bias  of the algorithms at the heart <br>of these technologies (and of the data scientists who develop them) and how <br>these new technologies are not only entrenching, but actually intensifying <br>racial violence in the "real world.". Along with other civil society <br>actors waging battles in national, regional, and international spaces to <br>counter this trend, we, at Afalab, believe that  we cannot let algorithms <br>reproduce and extend racial violence. </p>  <p>  <br>In a context where the denial and invisibilization of historical and <br>contemporary racial injustices by state institutions as well as private actors <br>remain the norm, big data can help us highlight the systemic character of <br>racial injustices. Indeed, with European states refusing to collect <br>race-related data and reducing racism to isolated experiences of personal <br>prejudices,  we consider it imperative to explore the opportunities that big <br>data offer for making visible the extent and nature of racial injustices in <br>Europe.  <br>  <br>We are acutely aware that big data won’t be the unique solution and that it has to be <br>complemented with other forms of data and rigorous analysis. Nonetheless, we <br>consider the urgency of racial inequalities in Europe, along with the <br>systematic refusal of states to collect data on race, as sufficient reasons to <br>explore the affordances of big data for addressing a critical void in the fight <br>for racial justice in Europe.  </p>  <p> Therefore, African Futures Lab is developing a <br>"Global Racial Inequality Dashboard" that  </p>  <p>  <br> Monitors racial injustices within <br>     and across countries in Europe and Africa  <br> Documents demands for racial justice in those <br>     regions  <br> Highlights institutional actions are taken to <br>     address these issues  <br> Fills gaps in state-collected data (especially <br>     in Europe) related to racial disparities and violence  <br> It will leverage data from a wide variety of <br>     traditional and non-traditional sources, including existing datasets, <br>     reports from civil society organizations, legal documents, and social <br>     media to present a fuller picture of the effects of racism in an <br>     accessible and actionable manner.  <br> </p>  <p>   </p>
