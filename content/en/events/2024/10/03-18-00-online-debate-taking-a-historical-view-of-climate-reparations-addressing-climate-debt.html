    <p>  <br>In this online debate, we will explore one of the most pressing challenges of our time—climate reparations and the concept of climate debt. As the global community increasingly recognizes the historical responsibility of European and  industrialized nations for exacerbating the climate crisis through centuries of industrialization and pollution, the demand to settle climate debt has intensified.</p>  <p>   <br>Though the idea of climate debt is well-defined at international forums, applying this concept in practice remains elusive. To address this, we need to take a step back and examine the historical context—starting from colonialism to modern industrialization—tracing the roots of climate reparations. By understanding the past, we can pave a more effective path toward meaningful climate justice. <br>In this debate, we’ll discuss how to transition from acknowledgement of climate debt to tangible reparations. What legal and policy frameworks can be utilized, and how can history shape the path forward?</p>  <p> Guest Speakers  <br>   <br>Krishnee Appadoo: Senior Lecturer in Law, Environmental Activist, and Social Entrepreneur. She is a Senior Lecturer in Law at the University of Mauritius, specializing in Environmental Law, Climate Change Law, and Policy. As the founder of Climate Justice Compact, she actively promotes climate justice and advocates for a fairer approach to addressing the climate crisis. Her insights into the legal frameworks surrounding climate reparations will be a crucial perspective in this conversation. <br>James Gondi: <br>Human Rights Lawyer, Environmental Justice Advocate, and International Legal Expert. He is a seasoned Human Rights Lawyer with over 15 years of experience, specializing in transitional and climate justice. His work includes serving as Africa's High-Level Coordinator at Stop Ecocide International, where he advocated for the recognition of ecocide as an international crime. His extensive background in governance and environmental law positions him as a key voice in this debate.</p>  <p>   <br>Date: Thursday, October 3, 2024Time:  4:00 PM (UTC+2)  Online streaming (registration required)</p>  <p>   <br>Register to attend </p>  <p>Register  <br>https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_w2MzQ9FWR2az5smU3US3OA#/registration</p>
