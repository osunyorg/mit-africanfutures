  <p>Menna Agha is an architect and Assistant Professor at the University of Carleton. She has recently been coordinating the spatial justice agenda at the Flanders Architecture Institute in Belgium. She is a third-generation displaced Fadicha Nubian, a legacy that infuses her research interests in race, gender, space, and territory. Among her publications are: <i>Nubia still exists: The Utility of the Nostalgic Space</i>; <i>The Non-work of the Unimportant: The shadow economy of Nubian women in displacement villages</i>; and <i>Liminal Publics, Marginal Resistance</i>.</p>
