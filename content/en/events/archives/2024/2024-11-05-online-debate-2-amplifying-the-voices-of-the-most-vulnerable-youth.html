She highlighted the need for accessible funding and the active participation of women, who are disproportionately affected by climate change, in decision-making processes. Hamira also addressed the barriers young activists face, including visa issues that hinder their attendance at international events.</p><p>Hyacinthe, a water scientist and climate negotiator specializing in Loss and Damage, serves as Coordinator at the<a href="https://www.lossanddamagecollaboration.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Loss and Damage Collaboration (L&DC) <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>. She focused on strategies to empower negotiators and build confidence among young activists, stressing the value of storytelling to ground discussions in real experiences.
