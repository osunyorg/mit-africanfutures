biography: >-
  <p>Lakshita Kanhiya (she/her) is a Mauritian human rights advocate and scholar whose work focuses on the intersections of religion, sexuality, climate justice, and governance in the Global South. She brings extensive experience across civil society, academia, regional human rights mechanisms, and international partnerships, and is committed to advancing transformative justice and inclusive social change </p><p>Lakshita's project examines the historical and contemporary tensions between slavery and indentured labour systems in the Indian Ocean, with a focus on Mauritius. By tracing how these intertwined legacies shape race, identity, and structural inequality, the project reimagines justice and memory for African futures. Through archival research, decolonial analysis, and public engagement, it seeks to advance reparative and transformative narratives.  </p>
