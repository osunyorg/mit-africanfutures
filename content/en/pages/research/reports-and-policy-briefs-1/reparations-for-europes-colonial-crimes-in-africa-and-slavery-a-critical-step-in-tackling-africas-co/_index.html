  body: >-
    <p>  <br>This paper is an introduction to the African Futures Lab project, Pursuing an African Agenda for Reparations for Colonial Crimes and Slavery which consists of 7 research reports. It summarizes some of the key findings of these reports, which show, notably, that contrary to a commonly held viewpoint, demands for justice and reparations for colonial crimes and slavery have been voiced on the African continent over the last sixty years.</p>  <p>   <br>Our research shows that although violence tied to colonialism and slavery is at the root of the many political, economic, and social conflicts and crises faced by contemporary African societies, these historical crimes have received little interest from international organizations (state and non-state actors). Rather, demands for justice and reparations in Africa have faced a hostile environment marked by the continuity of colonial logics and, in certain contexts, repression by national governments.The Pursuing an African Agenda for Reparations for Colonial Crimes and Slavery project calls for supporting longstanding African demands for repair. Addressing these demands is not just a moral imperative; it is a critical step towards tackling the multiple crises faced by contemporary African societies.Furthermore, pursuing an African agenda for reparations requires adopting a holistic scope, in the sense that these efforts cannot be limited to redressing violence against individuals and groups, but must also consider injustices against institutions and states, as well as cultural and environmental ecosystems. Nor should reparations only apply to past injustices. Rather, they should also address injustices in the present day that are preventing the construction of a better future for the continent. </p>  <p>  You can download the full paper here <br>Reparations for Europe’s Colonial Crimes in Africa and Slavery: A Critical Step in Tackling Africa’s Contemporary Challenges</p>
