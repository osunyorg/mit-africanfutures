    New Look, Same Purpose: Introducing Our Evolved Brand Identity
  summary: >-
    <p>We are proud to unveil our new visual identity; a reimagined brand that reflects our unwavering mission to confront and dismantle global racial injustices across Africa and Europe.   </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>This transformation is the visual articulation of our growth, maturity, and expanded scope since our founding in 2021. It translates our core values: commitment to justice, integrity, reliability, creativity and optimism, into a visual language that resonates in grassroots spaces and global policy arenas alike.   </p>  <p>   <br>At the heart of our new logo is a distinctive "A" shaped into a  sepow  - an Akan symbol of leadership, justice, courage, and the sacred duty to protect one's community. Rooted in Pan‑African heritage, the sepow connects us to the Adinkra tradition of encoding powerful values into visual emblems; values that have long guided liberation movements across the African continent and its diaspora. This emblem blends those cultural foundations with a modern, universal form to create a symbol that is adaptable, clear, and commanding.  Our evolved brand identity goes far beyond a new logo. It is a complete visual system, encompassing bold Afrocentric colours, confident typography, and flexible layouts - built to ensure clarity, consistency, and impact across all communications. From policy briefs and media kits to events, campaigns, and digital platforms, this system enables us to speak with one recognizable voice wherever our advocacy takes us.</p>  <p>   <br>It also makes visible the three pillars that anchor our work:   <br> Reparatory Justice:  Securing recognition and redress for historical and ongoing racial harms.   <br> Gender Justice and Reparations:  Confronting the enduring legacies of racialized and gendered violence and dismantling the culture of impunity that sustains systemic oppression.   <br> Climate Justice and Reparations:  Addressing the disproportionate impact of climate change on Africa and people of African descent, especially Black women, and demanding reparative action.  Our new identity is both a tribute to the struggles that came before us and a tool for the battles ahead. It strengthens our ability to engage diverse audiences; from community organizers and journalists to policymakers and philanthropic allies, and to amplify the urgent message that racial justice is non‑negotiable.  This rebrand was made possible through our collaboration with  Florence Akyams , a graphic designer, illustrator, and art director based in Belgium, known for creating sustainable and meaningful visual identities for nonprofits. A graduate of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels, Florence brought her craft and vision to translate our mission into this dynamic new visual identity.     </p>  <p>   <br>Take a moment to explore our revamped website to see the latest updates from us.  We would love to hear from you - if something sparks your curiosity or feedback, or reach out to us at info@afalab.org. </p>
