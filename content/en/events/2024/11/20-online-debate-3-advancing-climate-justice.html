    Online Debate 3: Advancing Climate Justice How to Leverage International Law and Litigation for Effective Climate Reparations?
  summary: >-
    
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The third debate on climate reparations, titled  “Advancing Climate Justice: How to Leverage International Law and Litigation for Effective Climate Reparations,”  featured three expert panelists: Krishnee Appadoo, Senior Lecturer in Law at the  University of Mauritius , Samira Ben Ali, Outreach Coordinator for the  World’s Youth for Climate Justice Campaign , and Joie Chowdhury, Senior Attorney at the  Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) . During the online debate, the panelists discussed the obstacles in advancing climate reparations, including the lack of binding accountability, and emphasized the role of civil society and innovative legal strategies in pushing for justice. Appadoo highlighted the importance of utilizing existing legal frameworks like the Paris Agreement and the Loss and Damage Fund, while also noting the growing influence of climate litigation and the role NGOs can play in these efforts. Ben Ali focused on the human rights aspects, discussing how small island states are seeking compensation for climate harm and the challenges in connecting climate reparations with legal institutions. Chowdhury emphasized the need for states to be held accountable under international law and the importance of advisory opinions in clarifying reparations, arguing that legal frameworks must evolve to support the most vulnerable communities. While challenges remain, such as the lack of binding legal mechanisms and the difficulty of holding major polluters accountable, the debate reinforced the need for a global collective effort to secure meaningful reparations. Moving forward, success in climate justice will rely on closer collaboration between legal experts, grassroots movements, and international institutions.</p>
