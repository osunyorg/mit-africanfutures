    <p>  <br>Position:   Research Consultant  Location:  Remote with possibility of in-country fieldwork  Duration:  3-6 months (depending on case study)  Application window:   15 December 2025 - 15 January 2026, midnight (CET).</p>  <p>   <br>Job title:  Head of Operations and Finance <br> Work location:  East Africa, preferably Nairobi <br> Contract type:  Full-time <br> Contract duration:  Two years <br> Application window:  15 December 2025 – 20 January 2026 (midnight EAT). </p>  <p> Context   <br>   <br>Position:   Research Consultant  <br> Location:  Remote with possibility of in-country fieldwork  <br> Duration:  3-6 months (depending on case study)  <br> Application window:   15 December 2025 - 15 January 2026, midnight (CET).</p>  <p>   <br>Across the African continent, major “green” development projects such as hydrogen corridors, mega-solar complexes, wind farms, biofuel schemes, carbon offset plantations, and mining for transition minerals are reshaping land, livelihoods, ecosystems and political power. They are framed as climate solutions and sustainable development opportunities but often reproduce the political and economic logics of earlier colonial regimes: extraction without consent, racialized dispossession, land grabs, gendered harms and environmental degradation. These schemes can be characterised as neocolonial in that they often serve to secure continued wealth accumulation in the global North while enabling major corporate actors to evade responsibility for the harms they generate, where vulnerable and indigenous communities are at the forefront    <br> African women and girls absorb a disproportionate share of these impacts: They suffer loss of communal or individually farmed land; bear increased unpaid care burdens; heightened exposure to labour exploitation and multiform gender-based violence around extractive sites; exclusion from decision-making, compensation processes, and other benefit-sharing mechanisms; erosion of food systems that women sustain; policing, surveillance, and restricted mobility (environmental defenders) linked to “strategic” green projects.  <br> These harms sit at the intersection of colonial histories and legacies, contemporary economic restructuring, and climate crisis politics.  <br> To advance and ground our advocacy on climate justice and reparations for Africa, this initiative seeks case studies that document the colonial heritage and contemporary legacies shaping climate justice struggles in African countries. These may take the form of:   <br>  <br>  <br> historical and genealogical analyse s (e.g. to trace the colonial legacy of laws, customs, practices, and patterns). Please note, we are looking for concrete case studies, not theoretical works);  <br>  <br>  <br> community-specific investigations  (e.g. community-driven studies emerging from grassroots organizing; case studies that document the lived realities of African women within these new “green” frontiers); or  <br>  <br>  <br> comparative studies and mapping analyses  (e.g., Pan-African, regional, or cross-border studies mapping communities, CSOs, and states that have made or are making concrete demands for reparative climate justice.)   </p>  <p> Research objectives   <br>   <br>Case studies could aim to:  <br>  <br> Examine how contemporary climate or energy initiatives reflect longer historical/colonial trajectories of extraction, racial hierarchy, and economic control.  <br>  <br> Center the experiences, perspectives, and strategies of affected communities, in particular, of African women  <br>  <br> Map the roles and responsibilities of state institutions, private actors, financial institutions, and international climate governance arrangements.  <br>  <br> Identify implications and mechanisms for climate reparations, including avenues for redress, structural change, and community-driven solutions.   <br> </p>  <p>  Intersectional approach   <br>   <br>To be eligible, case studies should take seriously how race, gender, class, geography, and historical inequality shape exposure to climate harm and the distribution of costs and benefits.  <br> For example, this could include examining:  <br>  <br> differentiated access to land, capital, and decision-making  <br>  <br> gendered labor dynamics across formal and informal economies  <br>  <br> exposure to violence, coercion, or exploitative labor arrangements  <br>  <br> the burdens linked to environmental degradation, resource depletion, or displacement  <br>  <br> cultural and social norms shaping women’s roles, constraints, and possibilities   <br>  <br> </p>  <p> Deliverables   <br>   <br>Case study report (30-40 pages).  Accessible community/public-facing summary (1,000-1,500 words).  Field documentation (interview notes, testimonies, observations).  Policy brief (max. 10 pages) outlining implications for climate justice and reparations.  <br>  <br> </p>  <p> Required qualifications   <br>   <br>PhD or advanced master's degree in law, political science, anthropology, history, geography, development studies, or any relevant social science  <br> Demonstrated expertise in environmental justice, extractive economies, gender analysis, or historical research  <br>  <br> Strong understanding of African contexts, economies, and societies.  <br>  <br> Field research experience, preferably with African women or marginalized communities.  <br> Strong analytical and writing skills with evidence of prior publications.  <br> Fluency in English; knowledge of French, Portuguese, Arabic, Kiswahili, or case study-relevant local languages is an asset.  <br>  <br> Commitment to ethical and community-centered methodologies.   <br> </p>  <p>  <br>  <br> </p>  <p> Who should apply   <br>   <br>Female candidates, feminist scholars and practitioners, and community-based researchers, particularly those based in the Global South, are encouraged to apply for this position.</p>  <p> How to apply   <br>   <br>Send the following to info@afalab.org with the subject line:  <br> “Application: Climate Reparations Case Study—[Country/Community concerned] ”  <br>  <br> CV  <br>  <br> Cover letter (max 2 pages)  <br>  <br> One or two writing samples  <br>  <br> Case study concept note (max 2 pages), specifying:  <br> - the community you intend to work with - the core research questions  <br> - proposed methodology  <br> - detailed timeline  <br> - anticipated challenges  <br> </p>  <p>  <br> We accept applications until 15 January 2026, midnight (CET). </p>
