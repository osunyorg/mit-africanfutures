    <p>  <br>AfaLab will be speaking on the panel "The Role of Global System & Structures in Reparatory Justice" at the Advancing Justice: Reparations and Racial Healing Summit in Accra, Ghana from August 1st to 4th, 2022.  Organized by the African Union, the Africa Transitional Justice Legacy Fund, the Africa-America Institute (AAI), and Global Black,  this summit intends to respond to the uneven responses currently being spurred on the question of reparations for the legacies of the Transatlantic slave trade and colonialism in Africa and the diaspora.  Keynote Speaker: Nana Akufo-Addo, President of the Republic of Ghana  The specific aims following the end of the Summit:  <br> To develop deeper, sophisticated, and more nuanced campaign strategies and the capacity to collectively advocate for reparatory justice and facilitate cross-country learning from contexts that have successfully pursued reparatory justice for historical crimes and injustices.  <br> To secure a commitment from influential European players to push for a process of reparatory justice from governments, financial institutions, and corporations in response to demands from CARICOM and emerging African Reparation Commissions   <br> To foster intercontinental reflections and collaborations with key actors across the continents. To globalize the discourse on reparatory justice and healing   <br> View more details on the event here:  https://accrasummit.com</p>
