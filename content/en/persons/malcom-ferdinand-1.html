biography: >-
  <p>At AfaRise, Malcom's research explores the intersections of ecology and racism in Afro-descendant communities. The project examines how experiences of racism, class, and gender inequality shape Afro-descendant and communities' exposure to and engagement with environmental change. It also foregrounds the ecological philosophies and practices developed within these communities as they respond to ecological challenges.  </p>
