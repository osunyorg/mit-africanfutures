    Meaningful participation of civil society and state actors in international negotiations concerning the climate reparations fund

    <p>  <br>Europe’s colonial violence has targeted natural resources and ecosystems throughout Africa, as well as individuals and communities. This has had major consequences for the African continent, which, despite contributing only 4% of global emissions, is suffering disproportionate effects of climate change. A number of international actors are mobilizing to tackle the consequences of climate change on the African continent. This research project conducted by  Sophie Kabaka  and  Liliane Umubyeyi  examines the participation of East African civil society and state actors in international negotiations concerning the climate reparations fund. By analyzing the dynamics in these negotiations, this research aims to understand if and how structural racial inequalities among Global North actors and East African actors are reproduced and what their impact is in terms of policy decisions.</p>
