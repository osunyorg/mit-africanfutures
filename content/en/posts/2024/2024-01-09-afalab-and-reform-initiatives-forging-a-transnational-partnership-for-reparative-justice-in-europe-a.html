    <p>  <br>We are thrilled to start this year by announcing our partnership with  Reform Initiatives ,  a pan-African think tank dedicated to advancing discussions on reparatory justice, human rights and democracy across Africa.</p>  <p>   <br>Our research reports have shown the importance of transnational coalitions in the fight against racial injustice on a global scale. This collaboration is a natural progression of our shared goals and commitment. Reform Initiatives is a West African-based organization founded by  Makmid Kamara , a human rights activist, researcher and development communications specialist with almost twenty years' experience in Africa and the UK. Together, we aim to strengthen the impact of reparative justice and shape the discourse on racial justice and reparations, both in Africa and in Europe.</p>  <p>  Find our joint statement announcing our partnership here  <br>Joint Statement from AfaLab and Reform Initiatives</p>
