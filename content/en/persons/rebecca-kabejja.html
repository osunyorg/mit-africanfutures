biography: >-
  <p>Rebecca's work aims at dismantling racial injustice and advancing justice for incarcerated women and girls worldwide.  </p><p>Her project - Afrikan Neighbour is a podcast co-created by two African women in Germany that reclaims space, disrupts dominant narratives, and builds transnational African solidarity. It addresses the afterlife of empire, where Blackness is surveilled, policed, and rendered "other," while also confronting the ongoing extraction, imperialism, and exploitation of the African continent. The podcast uses cultural memory, humour, and truth-telling to confront colonial amnesia, imperialism, resist racial authoritarianism, and reimagine African belonging beyond borders.  </p>
