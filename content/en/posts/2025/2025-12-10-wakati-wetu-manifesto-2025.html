    <p>  <br>As a co-convener of the  Wakati Wetu Festival , we are pleased to present the  Wakati Wetu Manifesto 2025 .  This manifesto emerged from Africa's first reparations festival and now stands as a central anchor for Africa's reparations agenda during the African Union's Decade of Justice. The  manifesto  affirms our shared commitment to reclaim our stories, repair long-standing harm, and resist the evolved systems of colonial capitalism and patriarchy that continue to shape racial power across financial and carbon markets. It challenges pity and charity narratives and makes clear that reparatory justice is a matter of accountability and the restoration of dignity. The manifesto  also places gender justice, climate justice, and economic justice at the heart of reparatory work. It calls for environmental repair and the reclamation of wealth extracted from African people and African lands by states and corporations. There is depth and ambition within this document. We hope it inspires Africans and people of African descent to break down the artificial barriers that separate our movements and sectors and to strengthen people power and collectivism across continents. As a partner in this work, we invite you to take part in the collective project of archival resurrection and moral archaeology. Together we can build a future rooted in accountability, dignity, and the renaissance of African thought, culture, and political possibility.  </p>  <p>Download your copy <br>https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nysaf9w767es7ouov0cq8/Wakati-Wetu-Festival-Manifesto.pdf?rlkey=6npoxwtxstx544npjdbfgryvp&st=rz6cr0sk&dl=0</p>
