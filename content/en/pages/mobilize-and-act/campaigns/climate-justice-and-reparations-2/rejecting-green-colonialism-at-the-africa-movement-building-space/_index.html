    <p>As part of the Movement of Movements, African Futures Lab proudly supports PowerShift Africa's policy brief: "Why Carbon Markets Are a Dangerous Distraction for Africa.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>This brief argues that carbon markets are a false solution to Africa's climate finance needs. Rather than delivering real, equitable, and transformative funding for climate action, these markets risk undermining Africa's climate sovereignty by entrenching extractive economic patterns, delaying Africa's just energy transition, fostering neocolonial land-grabs and, by failing to address climate change, further destabilizing the Earth's life support systems, leaving Africans first and worst affected.  By unpacking the scientific, economic, and political limitations of these mechanisms, the brief offers evidence-based guidance to help African stakeholders reject false solutions and push for more just, transparent, and grant-based forms of climate finance.   We reject carbon market schemes that entrench extractivism and perpetuate the exclusion of African women from climate decision-making. True justice lies in funding feminist, community-led alternatives, not profit-driven offsets. Read and download the policy brief.</p>
