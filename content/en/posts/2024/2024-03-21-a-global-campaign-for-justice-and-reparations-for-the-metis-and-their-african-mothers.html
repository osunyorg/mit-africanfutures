    <p>  <br>This campaign begins with the publication of our report  ‘‘70 Years of Fighting for Justice and Reparations: Mobilizations by "Métis" People from the Great Lakes Region Abducted by the Belgian Colonial Administration" , takes place in the specific political context of the Belgian and European elections.</p>  <p>   <br>Its goal is to highlight the demands for justice and reparations of the Métis and their families who were forced to stay in the Great Lakes region by the Belgian Colonial Administration. Additionally, this campaign aims to expose the limitations of the current mechanism adopted by the Belgian State to respond to the demands of those who are in Belgium. We will conduct this campaign on social media and through on-site events in Brussels, Geneva, Kinshasa, and Bujumbura. We are partnering with Amnesty International's Racial Justice team.</p>
