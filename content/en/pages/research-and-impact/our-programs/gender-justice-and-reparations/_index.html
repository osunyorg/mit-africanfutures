    Gender justice and reparations
  summary: >-
    <p>                    Our Gender Justice and Reparations program is driven by a vision for a world where Black women and girls across Africa and Europe are free from the enduring legacies of racialized and gendered violence. We are committed to dismantling the culture of impunity that enables systemic oppression.      </p>

    <p>Confronting the Past. Shaping the Future.  <br>   <br>The violence Black women face today is not accidental—it is the legacy of centuries of racial, gendered, and colonial domination. From the earliest days of European colonialism, Black women’s bodies, identities, and autonomy have been targeted through systems of control disguised as "civilization." Across the continent, colonial regimes imposed brutal policies: criminalizing cultural practices, legitimizing sexual violence, and using tactics like hostage-taking to coerce communities into submission. Laws were enacted to ban relationships between Black women and European men—not to protect women, but to preserve white supremacy. By the late 19th century, such unions were outlawed across German, French, Belgian, and British colonies. Mixed-race children were often taken from their mothers, erased from their cultures, or left stateless—acts of state-sponsored racial cleansing. Generations later, survivors and descendants are still fighting for recognition and reparations. Colonialism may have formally ended—but its violences persist. Today, Black women continue to be dehumanized: hypersexualized, blamed for poverty, or scapegoated for the climate crisis. These racist, patriarchal myths bleed into modern systems—from migration and policing to healthcare, tech, and reproductive policies. In 2018, a study showed Black women in the UK and US were 84% more likely to face online harassment than white women. In Mayotte, reports of forced sterilizations by French authorities echo the eugenic policies of past regimes—abuses that would be unthinkable in mainland France. Still, accountability is rare. Global frameworks for gender justice often ignore or sideline the intersecting oppressions faced by Black women. We reject that erasure.</p>  <p> What’s Ahead in 2025   <br>   <br> Flagship Research  A groundbreaking investigation into a critical, often-overlooked site of racialized gender-based violence.   <br>  <br> Podcast Series  A platform for powerful, intergenerational conversations that elevate Black women's voices, stories, and resistance.   <br>  <br> Mobilization Lab  A dynamic working group connecting grassroots organizers and civil society leaders to co-create strategies for action.   <br>  <br> Public Activation   A high-impact documentary and events-conference, festival, or exhibition-to spark awareness, build solidarity, and mobilize collective power.    <br>   <br>  </p>
