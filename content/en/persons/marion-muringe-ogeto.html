biography: >-
  <p>Marion Muringe Ogeto is a human rights lawyer and Gender Justice Specialist from Kenya with over five years experience working on gender justice in Africa in various organizations such as Equality Now. She holds an LLM from Columbia Law School where she was a Human Rights Fellow, and is an Advocate of the High Court of Kenya.   </p><p>Marion’s project seeks to conduct a study on how colonial rule institutionalized patriarchal norms in Africa and how there has been no post-colonial transitional justice framework. Colonial rule did not simply impose external governance, it restructured indigenous gender relations. For us to truly create a world where women and girls are truly free, we must examine these institutions, and develop mechanisms to reform, in line with genuine indigenous African culture. Thus the paper will analyse how colonial laws were adopted and how many of these legacies remain in African post-colonial systems.</p>
