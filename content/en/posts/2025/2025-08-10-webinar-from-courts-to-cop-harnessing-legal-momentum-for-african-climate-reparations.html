    <p>This webinar is organized by <img>African Union ECOSOCC, African Futures Lab and Biophilic Conversations  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Webinar date : Monday, 25 August 2025 Time:  10 AM UTC | 12 PM CAT | 1 PM EAT Registration link:   https://bit.ly/CourtCOP</p>  <p>   <br>On 25 August 2025, legal and climate experts will unpack a series of landmark rulings from the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea/Tribunal international du droit de la mer. These opinions confirm that states must act to prevent climate harm, regulate corporations, and provide reparations when they fail. With African civil society now asking the African Court on Human and Peoples'​ Rights for its own opinion, this webinar will explore how these legal decisions can strengthen Africa's demands for accountability and fair outcomes at COP30.  </p>
