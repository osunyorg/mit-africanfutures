    New Look, Same Purpose: Introducing Our Evolved Brand Identity
  summary: >-
    <p>We are proud to unveil our new visual identity; a reimagined brand that reflects our unwavering mission to confront and dismantle global racial injustices across Africa and Europe.   </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>This transformation is the visual articulation of our growth, maturity, and expanded scope since our founding in 2021. It translates our core values: commitment to justice, integrity, reliability, creativity and optimism, into a visual language that resonates in grassroots spaces and global policy arenas alike.   </p>  <p>   <br>At the heart of our new logo is a distinctive "A" shaped into a  sepow  - an Adinkra symbol of leadership, justice, courage, and the sacred duty to protect one's community. Rooted in Pan‑African heritage, the sepow connects us to the Adinkra tradition of encoding powerful values into visual emblems; values that have long guided liberation movements across the African continent and its diaspora. This emblem blends those cultural foundations with a modern, universal form to create a symbol that is adaptable, clear, and commanding.  Our evolved brand identity goes far beyond a new logo. It is a complete visual system, encompassing bold Afrocentric colours, confident typography, and flexible layouts - built to ensure clarity, consistency, and impact across all communications. From policy briefs and media kits to events, campaigns, and digital platforms, this system enables us to speak with one recognizable voice wherever our advocacy takes us.</p>  <p> Our Pillars: How We Drive Change  <br>   <br>Our work rests on two mutually reinforcing pillars: <br> 1. Research  <br>We produce rigorous, transdisciplinary research that makes visible the otherwise overlooked global systems of racial injustice. Our publications and submissions document harms, identify structural patterns, and propose actionable solutions grounded in evidence. <br> 2. Advocacy  <br>We translate research into action. Through strategic communications, coalition‑building, policy engagement, and public mobilisation, we push for reforms, reparations, and structural change - ensuring that decision‑makers and institutions are held accountable.  </p>  <p> Our Thematic Focus Areas  <br>   <br>  Our research and advocacy intersect across three urgent and interconnected themes:    <br> Reparatory Justice:  Securing recognition and redress for historical and ongoing racial harms.   <br> Gender Justice and Reparations:  Confronting the enduring legacies of racialized and gendered violence and dismantling the culture of impunity that sustains systemic oppression.   <br> Climate Justice and Reparations:  Addressing the disproportionate impact of climate change on Africa and people of African descent, especially Black women, and demanding reparative action.   </p>  <p> Our Colours, Our Story  <br>   <br>Our new palette reflects both the seriousness of our mission and the creativity with which we approach it. They are visual cues that reinforce our credibility, creativity, and commitment in every space we enter.   Our primary colors are:   </p>  <p>  <br>  <br> Dominant blue  symbolizes credibility, trust, research, and modernity. It signals our role as a rigorous, evidence‑driven organisation. <br>  <br>  <br> Purple  shows innovation, creativity, and intellectual rigor. It represents our ability to imagine and design just futures. <br>  <br>  <br> Red  is for passion, energy, and social engagement. It embodies our commitment to advocacy, movement‑building, and urgent action. <br> </p>  <p> A Website That Works as Hard as We Do  <br>   <br>Our redesigned website is a hub for action, knowledge, and connection. It is constructed with our community in mind; from policymakers to grassroots organizers - so you can all access our work, share it widely, and take action. The website categories are:  <br>  <br> Research & Impact  - Explore our publications, programs, and projects that reveal the scale and consequences of global racial injustices. <br>  <br>  <br> Mobilize & Act  - Engage with our mobilization labs (MobLabs), join our campaigns, and  AfaRise , our upcoming fellows.  <br>  <br> The Latest  - Stay informed with updates on our work, media mentions, appearances, features, and events. <br>  <br>  <br> Podcast (Future Perfect | Futures Antérieur) -  Hear   from voices shaping the fight for racial justice across Africa and Europe. <br>  <br>  <br> About Us  - Learn who we are, how we came to be, and access our annual reports. <br>  <br>  <br> Support Us  - Discover how to donate, partner with us, and subscribe to our newsletter. <br> </p>  <p> A Tribute and a Tool  <br>   <br>Our new identity is both a tribute to the struggles that came before us and a tool for the battles ahead. It strengthens our ability to engage diverse audiences; from community organizers and journalists to policymakers and philanthropic allies, and to amplify the urgent message that racial justice is non‑negotiable.   This rebrand was made possible through our collaboration with  Florence Akyams , a graphic designer, illustrator, and art director based in Belgium, known for creating sustainable and meaningful visual identities for nonprofits. A graduate of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels, Florence brought her craft and vision to translate our mission into this dynamic new visual identity.       </p>  <p>   <br>Take a moment to explore our revamped website to check out all the new updates.  We would love to hear from you - if something sparks your curiosity or feedback, reach out to us at  info@afalab.org .   </p>
