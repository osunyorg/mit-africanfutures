    <p>  <br>The African Futures Lab (AfaLab) is launching AfaRise Fellows - emphasizing elevation,  resistance and vision: a bold, two-year, fully virtual fellowship for visionary young researchers and activists dedicated to dismantling racial injustice across Africa and the global diaspora.  Rooted in reparatory justice, decolonial praxis, and Afro-feminist leadership, the fellowship fosters cross-continental collaboration and strategic action across the fields of race, gender, climate, and economic justice.Unlike conventional fellowships, AfaRise is explicitly anchored in reparatory justice, decolonial praxis, and Afro-feminist leadership - equipping fellows not only to influence policy, but to reshape the very narratives and systems that uphold racial injustice. Click here to apply .  Application deadline is 31 July 2025.  </p>  <p> Background and rationale  <br>   <br>The Afarise fellowship aligns with the African Union’s 2025 declaration as the  Year of Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations -  a pivotal moment to drive bold advocacy in a time of rising authoritarianism, global inequality, and fractured solidarity.  <br> While interest in reparations for racial injustices and decoloniality grows, African actors remain under-resourced, disconnected, and sidelined. AfaRise addresses this gap by cultivating a cohort of racial justice movers equipped to act locally and globally from an African and Afro-diasporic lens. <br> =&gt; Spark and support bold initiatives tackling racial justice and reparations across Africa and Europe <br> This dynamic program is designed to spark and support bold initiatives tackling racial justice and reparations across Africa and Europe.
