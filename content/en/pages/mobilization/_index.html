    <p>  <br>African Futures Lab mobilisation work aims at empowering civil society actors and private or public entities to demand justice and achieve reform. The invisibility of global racial injustices in public debate has made it difficult for civil society actors and private or public entities to advocate for justice and reparations or to take responsibility. Those who are willing to tackle these injustices feel powerless.  AfaLab supports civil society organisations, as well as private and public entities, in building and implementing strategies to tackle these racial injustices across Africa and Europe.  This support is built through  collaborative working spaces (Mobilisation Labs (MobLabs))  where strategies can be developed and/or strengthened. As multiple forms of expertise are necessary for revealing the many facets of global racial injustices, MobLabs brings together a range of specialists: historians, economists, anthropologists, lawyers, community organisers, communication experts and other relevant experts.  The result of this collaborative work can be an advocacy campaign or the implementation of policy reforms.  </p>
