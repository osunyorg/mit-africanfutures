    <p>  <br>		 <br>	 <br>	 <br>		  <br>			 <br>				 <br>					 This article aims to shed light on how Western legal and <br>judicial institutions have been maintained despite their <br>inadequacy in African countries, as well as how this <br>continuity inflicts violence on African populations. The <br>modernization paradigm at the heart of the colonial process <br>which explains the establishment of Western court systems <br>in African society has not only been maintained, it has been <br>buttressed by international development institutions whose <br>policies are reproducing Western visions of law and judicial <br>institutions, at least in part, to promote economic growth <br>and ensure the security of foreign investors. This article <br>shows how the inadequacies of these policies have led to multiple forms of violence perpetrated against African <br>populations deprived of their access to justice.  Authors:  Julien Moriceau,  &  Liliane Umubyeyi, PhD   <br>				 <br>			 <br>		</p>  <p>  You can download the full article here  <br> Decolonize Justice! A perspective on the role of international development policies and citizens’ experience of justice institutions</p>
