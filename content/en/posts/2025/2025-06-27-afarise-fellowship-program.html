    <p>African Futures Lab Fellowship Program </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The African Futures Lab (AfaLab) is launching AfaRise Fellows - emphasizing elevation,  resistance and vision: a bold, two-year, fully virtual fellowship for visionary young researchers and activists dedicated to dismantling racial injustice across Africa and the global diaspora. Rooted in reparatory justice, decolonial praxis, and Afro-feminist leadership, the fellowship fosters cross-continental collaboration and strategic action across the fields of race, gender, climate, and economic justice. Unlike conventional fellowships, AfaRise is explicitly anchored in reparatory justice, decolonial praxis, and Afro-feminist leadership - equipping fellows not only to influence policy, but to reshape the very narratives and systems that uphold racial injustice. Click here to apply   Application deadline is 31 July 2025.</p>  <p> Background and rationale  <br>   <br>Founded by two Black women,  Liliane Umubyeyi  and Amah Edoh, in response to the global reckoning on racial injustice following the 2020 Black Lives Matter movement, African Futures Lab advances reparative justice through research, advocacy, and cross-continental solidarity. Our mission is rooted in dismantling the enduring legacies of colonialism and slavery, holding state and private actors accountable, and supporting African and Afro-descendant communities to reclaim truth, dignity, and power. The fellowship aligns with the African Union's 2025 declaration as the  Year of Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations -  a pivotal moment to drive bold advocacy in a time of rising authoritarianism, global inequality, and fractured solidarity. While interest in reparations for racial injustices and decoloniality grows, African actors remain under-resourced, disconnected, and sidelined. AfaRise addresses this gap by cultivating a cohort of racial justice movers equipped to act locally and globally from an African and Afro-diasporic lens. =&gt; Spark and support bold initiatives tackling racial justice and reparations across Africa and Europe This dynamic program is designed to spark and support bold initiatives tackling racial justice and reparations across Africa and Europe.
