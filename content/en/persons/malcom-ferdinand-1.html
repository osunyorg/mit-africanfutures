biography: >-
  <p>Malcolm’s work sits on of intersectional racism and ecological justice. </p><p>His work with the AfaRise Fellowship, tentatively titled « Ecologies and Racism in Afro-descendant Communities », investigates how environmental change disproportionately affects Black communities through pollution and climate-related crises. Malcolm’s research is two-fold: it documents cases of environmental racism and the exclusion of Afro-descendant leaders from decision-making spaces, while simultaneously elevating the unique ecological philosophies practiced within these communities. While centered on Western Europe and France’s overseas territories, his work maintains a vital transoceanic dialogue with African continental perspectives to inform policies that safeguard fundamental rights.</p>
