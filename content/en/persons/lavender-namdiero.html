biography: >-
  <p>Lavender Namdiero is a bold and passionate human rights advocate with over eight years of experience campaigning for social, cultural, and economic justice across Africa. </p><p>From grassroots organizing to global advocacy, Lavender has worked at the intersection of activism and policy-amplifying voices too often left out of the room. She's led powerful campaigns on food justice, political inclusion, and reparations through roles at the SDG2 Advocacy Hub and Amnesty International. Lavender brings a decolonial and feminist lens to everything she does, with a knack for building coalitions that drive real change.</p><p><br>She holds a Master's in Human Rights from Central European University and believes in the power of African communities to tell their own stories and shape their own futures with joy, courage, and creativity.</p><p><br>When she's not advocating for justice, Lavender is likely befriending cats, doting on rescue animals, or dreaming of opening an animal sanctuary.  </p>
